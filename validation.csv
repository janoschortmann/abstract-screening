The case for healthcare supply chain management: Insights from problem-solving approaches,"The US healthcare industry is a large enterprise accounting for over 14.1% of the national economic output in 2001. It has been under pressure for cost containment and providing quality healthcare services to consumers. Its record of investing heavily in the development of sophisticated drugs and diagnostic systems does not match that of technologies to manage its day-to-day operations. In order to achieve improved performance, the healthcare supply chain must be efficient and integrated. The driver for this integration is logistics and supply chain management. This paper describes trends, issues and some solutions for logistics management for the healthcare supply chain with concepts drawn from industrial engineering, and operations research disciplines applied to specific domains. A healthcare supply chain template utilising e-commerce strategy is presented. Use of simulation, optimisation and information-sharing techniques are demonstrated to optimise purchasing and inventory policies. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",International Journal of Procurement Management,2008-01-01,10.1504/IJPM.2008.017525
TOWARD MORE REALISTIC SIMULATION MODELS USING OBJECT-CENTRIC PROCESS MINING,"Discrete-event simulation has been around for over half a century with applications in production, healthcare, logistics, transportation, etc. However, it is still challenging to create a reliable simulation model that mimics the actual process well and allows for “what-if” questions. Process mining allows for the automated discovery of stochastic process models using event data extracted from information systems. This technology is one of the key enablers for creating digital shadows and digital twins of operational processes. However, traditional process mining focuses on individual cases (e.g., an order, a patient, or a train) with events just referring to a single object (the case). Therefore, the discipline is moving to Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM), where events can refer to any number of objects. Based on research on OCPM and the prototypes developed, now also commercial software vendors are embracing OCPM, as illustrated by Celonis Process Sphere, which allows for the discovery and analysis of object-centric process models. We believe that OCPM will help to create much more realistic simulation models. Whereas process discovery is backward-looking, with object-centric simulation models, we can also support forward-looking forms of process mining. Although such techniques still need to be developed, they provide a unique opportunity to create more realistic digital twins of organizations and their processes.","Proceedings - European Council for Modelling and Simulation, ECMS",2023-01-01,
AI-Enabled Techniques for Intelligent Transportation System for Smarter Use of the Transport Network for Healthcare Services,"Although intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and e-healthcare are two different fields, they can be integrated to offer a seamless and efficient experience to patients, attendants, relatives, and other relevant individuals. ITS can play a crucial role in supporting healthcare services by optimizing the use of transportation networks for treatment and e-healthcare logistic purposes. The combination of ITS and e-healthcare can provide patients with better and more efficient healthcare while also improving the overall transport experience. The biggest challenge in this integration is addressing the existing issues of a complex transportation system. Traffic administration organizations worldwide face the challenge of managing road traffic and networks. ITS, being an excellent mix of data and correspondence systems, seems the best solution that could contribute toward an effective and safe logistic environment alongside the long-term feasibility of transportation systems. For quicker implementation of ITS, electronic media, hardware, programming tools, and automation are necessary. The support of specific specializations such as civil, electrical, mechanical, and industrial engineering might additionally contribute to ensuring that these technologies prove productive and supportive. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) offers immense opportunities for enhancing the effectiveness of various areas and ventures, including the transportation sector. Recently, an advanced computational algorithm that imitates the human brain has been introduced by AI. The information, communications, and control (ICT) technology could also be utilized to make the transportation system more effective, smooth, and safety oriented. These steps will act as the base for the fusion of ITS and e-healthcare, which will assist in reducing the medical support response time to routine and critical patients and in further developing public interest in ITS-based healthcare support. A detailed perspective of AI-based ITS merging with e-healthcare is covered in this chapter.",Blockchain and Deep Learning for Smart Healthcare,2024-01-01,
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Adaptation to Facilitate Healthcare Supply Chains in Low-Income Countries,"Low-income countries are persistently suffering from last-mile logistics issues in healthcare supply chains. Therefore, it is high time to explore technological applications to overcome such inadequacies. The faster speed, low maintenance cost, and absence of road dependency in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have popularized them as an alternative to road delivery. Hence, it is suggested as a solution to overcome the persisting distribution inefficiencies in healthcare logistics of low-income countries. According to the case study analysis conducted on the Sri Lankan vaccine cold chain, incorporating UAVs increases truck-space utilization and reduces the time consumed, cost incurred, and carbon dioxide emission in a delivery round. Moreover, the most suitable way to cover the initial setup cost of an unmanned aerial system (UAS) is by receiving aid from international donors. The capital cost also can be covered by government investments or via service outsourcing only if the number of flights per year is increased. Moreover, a homogenous (i.e., only UAV) solution was revealed to be more beneficial than a heterogeneous (i.e., truck and UAV) solution. However, due to the lack of technology literacy and willingness to change in low-income countries, it is recommended to initially execute a heterogeneous solution and expand to a homogeneous plan in the future years. However, it was evident that for a mixed-fleet solution to be advantageous, drone characteristics play a vital role. Hence, a UAV with specifications ideal for the use case must be utilized to garner the maximum benefits. Nevertheless, it was apparent that with the right implementation plan, UAVs possess the potential to overcome the shortcomings in the healthcare logistics of low-income countries.",Drones,2022-11-01,10.3390/drones6110321

Six Sigma Application in Healthcare Logistics: A Framework and A Case Study,"Six Sigma is used heavily in various industrial sectors, yet no noticeable applications are seen in healthcare logistics. This paper reveals the special case of healthcare logistics where cost reduction is not the only factor considered in project selection; performance and criticality of each item in the logistics system are of high importance as well. This paper provides a proposed framework to apply Six Sigma in the area of healthcare logistics. It also presents a case study implementing the proposed framework at a Jordanian hospital. In the case study, the paper reveals how the modifications of the define phase to take into consideration the criticality, cost, and performance of items make typical Six Sigma methodology very beneficial for healthcare logistics.

A quickly deployed and UAS-based logistics network for delivery of critical medical goods during healthcare system stress periods: A real use case in Valencia (Spain),"On the one hand, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) have experienced great applicability surge in the recent years, arising as a promising technology with a wide field of use. On the other hand, healthcare, a critical system in modern society, is subject to a heavy and unexpected pressure in the case of situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This article aims to leverage the flexibility of UASs as complementary support for healthcare logistic systems when under high-stress conditions, via quick deployment of an air delivery network. We have defined a logistics network model and created three scenarios based on the model and current needs in Valencia (Spain). Flight tests have been performed in these scenarios, which include urban areas and controlled airspace. Operations complied with requirements derived from the application of Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA) methodology, recently adopted by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Flights were successful, being able to swiftly deliver medical goods without requiring any dedicated infrastructure. However, a moderate number of contingencies took place during the tests, mainly related to control link quality and Air Traffic Management (ATM) integration, forcing the use of dedicated procedures to cope with them. Although additional development is required to ensure the safety of large-scale automated operations, the use of UASs as part of logistic networks is a feasible means to support existing structures, especially in situations in dire need.",Drones,2021-01-01,10.3390/DRONES5010013

Importance of 5G-enabled IoT for industrial automation,"5G-enabled IoT can make a significant contribution to society by providing and advancing intelligent services for human beings. The applications of 5G-enabled IoT range to all society segments, such as industry, agriculture, environment, traffic, healthcare, logistics, and many more. Thus, it comes up as a good topic to research and makes the masses aware of it. The scale by which human lives will be made more accessible, productive, secure, and healthy and the need for this to be brought forward by the masses serve as the motivation for this chapter. In this chapter, we describe 5G-enabled IoT and its importance in the modern industries. It should detail upon applications of 5G-enabled IoT, which are assumed to bring revolutions like smart cities, advanced healthcare, smart homes, automated agriculture, autonomous vehicles, intelligent supply chain management, and how all the applications will reduce cost and labor. We shall also briefly touch upon some of the disadvantages and some rumors of the upcoming fifth generation of the Internet, making the people stand against these modern technologies' uprise. 5G is the fifth generation of wireless technology. It is meant to provide very high data transfer speeds and more reliable networks, seamlessly connect a massive number of embedded sensors, and provide extremely low-cost connectivity solutions. The Internet of Things is a system of computing devices, sensors, etc. which are connected via the Internet and can communicate with each other, i.e., transfer data without any human intervention. However, with the advent of 5G, IoT is meant to go through revolutionary changes. 5G will enable us to remotely control a more significant number of devices and allow data transfers at benchmark speeds in applications where real-time network performance is critical. Thus, 5G will bring out the full potential of IoT. 5G-enabled IoT will leave a lasting expression in fields of automation, machine intelligence, and smart systems. As mentioned above, domains like smart cities, autonomous vehicles, automated factories, intelligent machine tools, augmented and virtual reality, healthcare, etc. are going to experience substantial technological advancements with the advent of 5G-enabled IoT systems. Innovation in the automation industry would boom as they have increased the use of IoT to connect cars, connecting with traffic and road services, etc. This vast increase in connected devices requires a superior network to manage it in overall speed, capacity, and latency. In these areas, 5G is set to make a significant improvement over current 4G LTE standards.",Blockchain for 5G-Enabled IoT: The new wave for Industrial Automation,2021-04-09,10.1007/978-3-030-67490-8_18
Digital innovation and the future of work,"The concept of digitalization captures the widespread adoption of digital technologies in our lives, in the structure and functioning of organizations and in the transformation of our economy and society. Digital technologies for data processing and communication underly high-impact innovations including the Internet of Things, wireless multimedia, artificial intelligence, big data, enterprise platforms, social networks and blockchain. These digital innovations not only bring new opportunities for prosperity and wellbeing but also affect our behaviors, activities, and daily lives. They enable and shape new forms of production and new working practices in sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, logistics and supply chains, energy, and public and business services. Digital innovations are not purely technological but form part of comprehensive systemic innovations of a sociotechnical and networked nature, requiring the alignment of technology, processes, organizations, and humans. Examples are platform-based work, customer driven value creating networks, and urban public service systems. Building on widespread networking, algorithmic decisions and sharing of personal data, these innovations raise intensive societal and ethical debates regarding key issues such as data sovereignty and privacy intrusion, business models based on data surveillance and negative externalization, quality of work and jobs, and market dominance versus regulation. In this context, this book focuses on the implications of digitalization for the domain of work. The book studies the changing nature of work as well as new forms of digitally enabled organizations, work practices and cooperation. The book sheds light on the technological, economic, and political forces shaping the new world of work and on the prospects for human-centric and responsible innovations. To this end, the book brings together a number of studies in five major topics: 1. The evolution of digital technology impacting ways of working; 2. The role of artificial intelligence in new ways of working; 3. Transformation of work, jobs and employment; 4. Digitalization and need for skills and competencies; and 5. New forms of decentralized working and cooperation.",Digital Innovation and the Future of Work,2020-11-30,
Influenza vaccine uptake among older adults in Brazil: Socioeconomic equality and the role of preventive policies and public services,"Background: Influenza is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Since 1999, influenza vaccine is provided free-of-charge to adults aged 60 years or more in Brazil. Although vaccination coverage is high, previous studies have shown that socioeconomic and lifestyle factors play an essential role in predicting vaccine uptake. This study aimed to investigate whether previous knowledge of factors that constrain influenza vaccine uptake among older adults contributed to increasing the access to vaccination in 2015–16. Methods: This cross-sectional study assessed data from the baseline of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging. This national representative sample encompassed individuals aged 60 and older (n = 5221). Vaccination status was the outcome variable; covariates included socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics, health status, and access to healthcare. Logistic regression fitted the association between vaccine uptake and covariates. Results: The coverage of influenza vaccination was 73.0% (95% confidence interval: 70.6–75.2); ranking lower than the goal of 80% set up by the national health authority. The most frequent reasons to justify the option of skipping vaccination were cultural beliefs about the lack of efficacy and possible side effects of the vaccine. The coverage of vaccination did not differ by socioeconomic characteristics. Older individuals, never smokers, having two or more chronic diseases, and being registered in the Family Health Program were positively associated with influenza vaccine uptake. Conclusions: Absent socioeconomic inequalities point out changes in the barriers to vaccination. These findings provide insights into tailoring public health strategies, targeting professional recommendations and public perceptions of the vaccine.",Journal of Infection and Public Health,2020-02-01,10.1016/j.jiph.2019.07.022
Stochastic medical tourism problem with variable residence time considering gravity function,"Medical tourism is a recent term in healthcare logistics referring to travel of patients to receive health services and spending leisure time in a destination country. This transferring of patients leads to access high-quality health services which are cheaper than the original country of patients. During this travel, passengers who are the patients from another country, have this opportunity for complimentary entertainment packages (e.g., pleasure tours) in the aftercare period. As far as we know, the term of medical tourism is rarely studied in healthcare logistics and such services are highly important for developing countries. Such facts motivate us to develop a practical optimization model for the Medical Tour Centers (MTCs) for allocation of patients to hospitals in proper time and creation of memorable aftercare time for them. In this regard, the main aim of the proposed model is to maximize the total profit of MTCs through optimal allocation of patients to hospitals while considering an aftercare tour for the passengers. To make the proposed model more realistic, the optimal residence time in attractive places is simulated by a time-dependent gravity function. To address the uncertainty of medical tourism problem, a scenario-based two-stage stochastic optimization approach is extended to encounter different sources of uncertainty existing in surgical success, medical time, restoration restrictions, and the attraction of tourist places. Another novelty of this work is to propose an innovative hybrid meta-heuristic for large-scale instances, which is a combination of Progressive Hedging Algorithm (PHA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The model is analyzed by different test problems for small, medium, and large-scale instances where the hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm could solve them with an average gap of 3.4% in comparison with the commercial solver. The results revealed the importance of tourist opinion and public preferences in medical and pleasure tours, respectively, to improve the economic growth in this sector in developing countries.",RAIRO - Operations Research,2022-05-01,10.1051/ro/2022082
Hybrid predetection technique for efficient tag identification in radio-frequency identification systems,"Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is a noncontact automatic identification technology that has been widely used in various modern industries. Due to the continuous improvement in sensing capabilities, energy autonomy, affordability, and usability, RFID is one of the key enabling technologies in realizing the Internet of Things (IoT). With their non-line-of-sight wireless transmission, wireless power, and sensing capability, lightweight RFID sensor tags can be connected to people or objects, which is crucial for future IoT applications such as healthcare, logistics, and manufacturing. The RFID approach with the simultaneous reading of multiple tag features can quickly identify connected “things” for further data communication and integration. Reducing the identification processing time for many tags located inside the interrogation range of the reader is essential. Therefore, an effective protocol must be developed to prevent collisions and reduce useless queries between the reader and tags to achieve rapid identification. Predetection tree-based algorithms, which are based on certain small predetection timeslots that tags can respond to, can eliminate unnecessary idle slots and prevent collision slots. In this paper, an efficient predetection-based anticollision algorithm has been proposed to achieve outstanding tag identification performance. The numbers of collision slots and idle slots are reduced by exploiting a novel predetection mechanism and slot size adjustment technique. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme reduces the tag identification time by approximately 30-60% compared with previously proposed predetection-based protocols. Moreover, the numbers of query cycles, collisions, and slots are smaller in the proposed scheme than in the previously proposed protocols.",Sensors and Materials,2021-01-01,10.18494/SAM.2021.3381
Bio-inspired algorithms applied to the multi-objective vehicle routing problem: Frameworks and applications,"The multi-objective vehicle routing problem (MOVRP) is an extension of the vehicle routing problem (VRP). MOVRP is a classic multi-objective optimization problem. In recent years, the MOVRP has been applied for increased problem scales and complexity levels. As a result, to obtain better solutions to the MOVRP, bio-inspired algorithms have been introduced into this domain. This article provides an analysis of the MOVRP framework and a review of the bio-inspired algorithm approaches designed to solve MOVRPs. We thereby identify the bio-inspired algorithms that can achieve better solutions for MOVRPs and can be successfully applied to real-life situations. Some heating practical research areas of MOVRP, which include green vehicle routing, healthcare logistics, school bus routing and food supply chain management, are discussed as well.",Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience,2016-06-01,10.1166/jctn.2016.5240
Optimising the booking horizon in healthcare clinics considering no-shows and cancellations,"Patient no-shows and cancellations are a significant problem to healthcare clinics, as they compromise a clinic's efficiency. Therefore, it is important to account for both no-shows and cancellations into the design of appointment systems. To provide additional empirical evidence on no-show and cancellation behaviour, we assess outpatient clinic data from two healthcare providers in the USA and EU: no-show and cancellation rates increase with the scheduling interval, which is the number of days from the appointment creation to the date the appointment is scheduled for. We show the temporal cancellation behaviour for multiple scheduling intervals is bimodally distributed. To improve the efficiency of clinics at a tactical level of control, we determine the optimal booking horizon such that the impact of no-shows and cancellations through high scheduling intervals is minimised, against a cost of rejecting patients. Where the majority of the literature only includes a fixed no-show rate, we include both a cancellation rate and a time-dependent no-show rate. We propose an analytical queuing model with balking and reneging, to determine the optimal booking horizon. Simulation experiments show that the assumptions of this model are viable. Computational results demonstrate general applicability of our model by case studies of two hospitals.",International Journal of Production Research,2022-01-01,10.1080/00207543.2021.1913292
Design an Indoor Positioning System Using ESP32 Ultra-Wide Band Module,"In recent years, Indoor Positioning Systems have always captivated a colossal repercussion on many end-user applications such as medical healthcare, logistic and warehouse, smart buildings, military, etc. In particular, indoor tracking often requires high accurate localization. However, positioning precision is restricted by various hindrances within the mise-en-scène, especially the Non-Line-Of-Sight context which affects signal dispersion and occlusions. The proliferation of numerous RF technologies, such as RFID, WiFi, Bluetooth or Zigbee, etc. facilitates users to detect an object’s location within a peculiar range. Consequently, in the scope of this paper, a short-range technology system is developed for indoor positioning. The system is exploited properly to trail an object equipped with a small tag using Ultra-Wide Band module as ESP32. For the exact localization of the matter, the method measures the running time of wave between the object and at least two receivers (called bilateration). Also, the model is validated through a good accordant comparison between simulation and experimental results.",Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies,2023-01-01,10.1007/978-3-031-46573-4_35
Develop a strategy for improving healthcare logistics performance,"Recently, there has been a great interest in applying logistics and supply chain management practice and strategy in healthcare services. This paper proposes a strategy for improving healthcare logistics performance. Eighteen hospitals located in different countries, namely Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, and Thailand, were interviewed about their national and operational performance. The tool for assessing national healthcare performance, that is, the Health Metric Network framework, developed by the World Health Organization in 2008 was applied to assess the healthcare logistics infrastructure of those countries. Furthermore, we developed set of logistics performance indicators at the operational level. The Analytical Network Process methodology was used to develop the hierarchical measurement for those operational healthcare logistics performances. The results show interdependencies between operational and national performance. The operational performance is affected by the country’s environment. Finally, a strategy for improving healthcare logistics performance is proposed. The interdependences between operational and national performance are discussed.",Supply Chain Forum,2018-01-01,10.1080/16258312.2017.1416876
Multicommodity flows and Benders decomposition for restricted continuous location problems,"The restricted continuous facility location problem arises when there is a need to locate a number of facilities to serve a discrete set of demand points, and where the location of a facility can be anywhere on the plane except for in restricted regions. The problem finds applications in urban planning, disaster management, and healthcare logistics. The restricted regions can occur randomly or are known in advance. The paper describes a new model for the problem that is based on multicommodity flows with unknown destinations and defined on a discretization of the plane. The model and discretization are applied to both the deterministic and the stochastic continuous restricted location problem, where the latter is converted into a deterministic equivalent problem by minimizing the expected value of the objective function weighted by the probabilities of scenarios. The paper also describes a Benders decomposition algorithm to optimally solve the model. Extensive computational results are presented on both benchmark instances from the literature and new instances, on both the deterministic and stochastic variant of the problem. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is superior to an off-the-shelf solver in terms of computational time. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the exact algorithm described here is the first to address both the deterministic and the stochastic variants of continuous restricted location problems with any number of facilities.",European Journal of Operational Research,2018-05-01,10.1016/j.ejor.2017.11.033
A Pattern Adherence Analysis to a Blockchain Web Application,"Blockchain is an emerging technology that is attracting a lot of attention from both academia and industry. Blockchain when used as a decentralized technology could be utilized in various useful applications, such as healthcare, logistics, supply chain management, education, among others. However, there is the integration factor between technologies and environments, which have their own characteristics and challenges. A pattern is a solution with reusable fetures for a problem that commonly occurs in a given context during software design phases. Usually, when adopting a design pattern, there are trade-offs among quality attributes. In this context, using patterns can promote a better use for blockchain in traditional application and system development, and disseminate best practices. The aim of this paper is to analyze a traditional web application that uses blockchain features from the viewpoint of some patterns, specifically patterns that describe the blockchain integration with the outside world. As a result, we found that applying blockchain patterns can benefit systems, especially those that require integration with other systems, such as legacy or existing.","Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture Companion, ICSA-C 2020",2020-03-01,10.1109/ICSA-C50368.2020.00028
Occupational safety and health and smaller organisations: Research challenges and opportunities,"Despite the prevalence of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and micro organisations, comparatively little is known about how such organisations approach occupational safety and health (OSH). Research has tended to present a negative picture of OSH practices in smaller organisations. This paper discusses some of the challenges to researching OSH in SMEs and micro organisations and how these challenges can be overcome. It draws lessons and experiences from a qualitative study involving 149 structured interviews, nine short-term ethnographies and 21 semi-structured interviews with owners and employees in SMEs and micro organisations from a broad cross-section of industry sectors in the UK, including construction, retail, healthcare, logistics and agriculture. Data from the study suggest that the established boundaries between micro, small and medium-sized enterprises are less meaningful in an OSH context – OSH practices are influenced more by the culture of the organisation, the type of work being undertaken and the sector that an organisation operates in. OSH practices in SMEs and micro organisations tend to reflect more informal characteristics of such organisations, with more emphasis (than many larger organisations) on tacit knowledge, learning by doing and improvisation. Such practices should not necessarily be assumed to be unsafe or incompatible with formalised OSH.",Policy and Practice in Health and Safety,2016-01-01,10.1080/14773996.2016.1239357

Improved energy efficiency in D2D healthcare communication,"This paper addresses the minimization of energy consumption in device-to-device (D2D) communications in the healthcare logistics domain. Given the vital importance of actions in this field for patients' lives, it is crucial to reduce the energy consumed by the devices used. This study aims to propose a fuzzy approach to predict the energy consumption induced by different protocols in D2D communications to minimize the energy consumption of healthcare logistics devices. A fuzzy supervisor is developed to evaluate and forecast the energy consumption of the devices in D2D communications. This approach allows for obtaining more accurate predictions and a better understanding of how device energy consumption can be reduced. Numerical simulations were conducted to validate the proposed method. The results show the efficiency and sustainability of D2D communication systems and a significant reduction in energy consumption when a classical method is applied.",International Journal of Advances in Soft Computing and its Applications,2023-01-01,10.15849/IJASCA.230720.08
