Develop a strategy for improving healthcare logistics performance,"Recently, there has been a great interest in applying logistics and supply chain management practice and strategy in healthcare services. This paper proposes a strategy for improving healthcare logistics performance. Eighteen hospitals located in different countries, namely Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, and Thailand, were interviewed about their national and operational performance. The tool for assessing national healthcare performance, that is, the Health Metric Network framework, developed by the World Health Organization in 2008 was applied to assess the healthcare logistics infrastructure of those countries. Furthermore, we developed set of logistics performance indicators at the operational level. The Analytical Network Process methodology was used to develop the hierarchical measurement for those operational healthcare logistics performances. The results show interdependencies between operational and national performance. The operational performance is affected by the country’s environment. Finally, a strategy for improving healthcare logistics performance is proposed. The interdependences between operational and national performance are discussed.",Supply Chain Forum,2018-01-01,10.1080/16258312.2017.1416876
Model-based testing as a service for IoT platforms,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has increased its footprint becoming globally a ‘must have’ for today’s most innovative companies. Applications extend to multitude of domains, such as smart cities, healthcare, logistics, manufacturing, etc. Gartner Group estimates an increase up to 21 billion connected things by 2020. To manage ‘things’ heterogeneity and data streams over large scale and secured deployments, IoT and data platforms are becoming a central part of the IoT. To respond to this fast growing demand we see more and more platforms being developed, requiring systematic testing. Combining Model-Based Testing (MBT) technique and a service-oriented solution, we present Model-Based Testing As A Service (MBTAAS) for testing data and IoT platforms. In this paper, we present a first step towards MBTAAS for data and IoT Platforms, with experimentation on FIWARE, one of the EU most emerging IoT enabled platforms.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2016-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-47169-3_55
ONLINE CAPACITY PLANNING for REHABILITATION TREATMENTS: AN APPROXIMATE DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING APPROACH,"We study an online capacity planning problem in which arriving patients require a series of appointments at several departments, within a certain access time target. This research is motivated by a study of rehabilitation planning practices at the Sint Maartenskliniek hospital (the Netherlands). In practice, the prescribed treatments and activities are typically booked starting in the first available week, leaving no space for urgent patients who require a series of appointments at a short notice. This leads to the rescheduling of appointments or long access times for urgent patients, which has a negative effect on the quality of care and on patient satisfaction. We propose an approach for allocating capacity to patients at the moment of their arrival, in such a way that the total number of requests booked within their corresponding access time targets is maximized. The model considers online decision making regarding multi-priority, multi-appointment, and multi-resource capacity allocation. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that takes into account the current patient schedule, and future arrivals. We develop an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to obtain approximate optimal capacity allocation policies. We provide insights into the characteristics of the optimal policies and evaluate the performance of the resulting policies using simulation.",Probability in the Engineering and Informational Sciences,2020-07-01,10.1017/S0269964818000402
Selective vehicle routing for a mobile blood donation system,"In this study, a mobile blood collection system is designed with the primary objective of increasing blood collection levels. This design also takes into account operational costs to aim for collection of large amounts of blood at reasonable cost. Bloodmobiles perform direct tours to certain activities to collect blood, but at the end of each day, they bring the collected blood to a designated depot to prevent its spoilage. The proposed system consists of the bloodmobiles and a new vehicle called the shuttle that visits the bloodmobiles in the field on each day and transfers the collected blood to the depot. Consequently, bloodmobiles can continue their tours without having to make daily returns to the depot. We propose a mathematical model and a 2-stage IP based heuristic algorithm to determine the tours of the bloodmobiles and the shuttle, and their lengths of stay at each stop. This new problem is defined as an extension of the Selective Vehicle Routing Problem and is referred to as the SVRP with Integrated Tours. The performances of the solution methodologies are tested first on a real data set obtained from past blood donation activities of Turkish Red Crescent in Ankara, and then on a constructed data set based on GIS data of the European part of Istanbul. The Pareto set of optimum solutions is generated based on blood amounts and logistics costs, and finally a sensitivity analysis on some important design parameters is conducted.",European Journal of Operational Research,2015-08-16,10.1016/j.ejor.2015.03.007
TOWARD MORE REALISTIC SIMULATION MODELS USING OBJECT-CENTRIC PROCESS MINING,"Discrete-event simulation has been around for over half a century with applications in production, healthcare, logistics, transportation, etc. However, it is still challenging to create a reliable simulation model that mimics the actual process well and allows for “what-if” questions. Process mining allows for the automated discovery of stochastic process models using event data extracted from information systems. This technology is one of the key enablers for creating digital shadows and digital twins of operational processes. However, traditional process mining focuses on individual cases (e.g., an order, a patient, or a train) with events just referring to a single object (the case). Therefore, the discipline is moving to Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM), where events can refer to any number of objects. Based on research on OCPM and the prototypes developed, now also commercial software vendors are embracing OCPM, as illustrated by Celonis Process Sphere, which allows for the discovery and analysis of object-centric process models. We believe that OCPM will help to create much more realistic simulation models. Whereas process discovery is backward-looking, with object-centric simulation models, we can also support forward-looking forms of process mining. Although such techniques still need to be developed, they provide a unique opportunity to create more realistic digital twins of organizations and their processes.","Proceedings - European Council for Modelling and Simulation, ECMS",2023-01-01,
Fractal-Based N-Environment Multi-Agent IoT System Reliability,"The tremendous growth of Internet of Things (IoT) systems and the popularity of distributed systems, which were brought back into fashion by containerisation, create new challenges for system maintenance. Each IoT-specific service is characterised by a specific domain, or environment, making the maintenance of distributed IoT systems with dozens of agents a challenging task. This paper proposes a fractal-based mathematical model, called the fractal multi-agent IoT system (FMAIS), for scalable multi-agent systems (e.g. cloud-native services, wide-scale IoT services). A reliability estimation model called the multi-environment enhanced real-time customer-oriented reliability estimation (ME-ERT-CORE) model is proposed as a method for estimating the reliability of a multi-agent IoT system, where each agent can be specified by its own domain-specific environment (e.g. healthcare, logistics, smart factories, etc.). An estimation of the time complexity of the FMAIS is performed, and a model called ME-ERT-CORE for estimating its reliability is formulated. The results show that the FMAIS can be used for real-time simulations of system behaviour and ME-ERT-CORE can be used for the real-time estimation of its reliability, monitoring purposes, and, for instance, quality of service (QoS) descriptions based on service level agreement (SLA) requirements. The conducted measurements show that the reliability of the FMAIS with 4 layers and 96 applications, where each application deploys 96 instances, can be computed in 8.022 milliseconds. With the proposed optimisation method, the reliability for the same FMAIS can be computed in 0.219 milliseconds, which is 36 times faster than the ME-ERT-CORE reliability evaluation based on the definition. An FMAIS with the aforementioned parameters can be simulated in 84.300 milliseconds.",IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024-01-01,10.1109/JIOT.2024.3398406
A fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis approach for risk evaluation in healthcare logistics outsourcing: Case of Morocco,"Public–private partnerships in emerging countries are gradually considered a tool for growth development. One particular public–private partnership is that of outsourcing logistics in the healthcare sector. These partnerships provide several benefits for both private and public sectors but are generally associated with numerous risks that must be evaluated and subsequently managed. The aim in this paper is to develop a risk evaluation approach to rank risks when decision makers’ judgment is taken into consideration and where traditional risk evaluation techniques become less applicable. The proposed approach makes use of fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis methods since they are efficient techniques to rank alternatives based on selected evaluation criteria and can accommodate human judgment and preferences. The approach treats predetermined risks like alternatives, and evaluation criteria are represented by areas of impact of the risks. To validate the approach, we applied it to a real case of logistics outsourcing to private service providers in a Moroccan public pharmaceutical supply chain. The ranking results obtained show that the two methods lead to some differences in ranking but are highly correlated. The obtained results support healthcare policy makers in setting priorities to effectively deploy preventive and mitigation efforts.",Health Services Management Research,2020-08-01,10.1177/0951484820901668
An Integrated Approach for Improving Logistics Systems: A Case Study of Hospital Logistics,"In order to provide an integrated approach to improve healthcare logistics. This paper integrated the analysis of logistics decisions made at the three hierarchical levels with the problem analysis and improvement suggestions. Following a thorough analysis of the problematic logistics decisions, alternative decisions were suggested to improve the current logistics system. The proposed forecasting technique is expected to reduce the average error in forecasting as a percent of average demand from 30.3% to 22.5%. The proposed methodology provides a new structured problem-analysis and problem-solving processes for healthcare logistics and it is expected to be a valuable management tool to improve the quality of patient care.",TEM Journal,2022-11-01,10.18421/TEM114-33
From network approach to ecosystem approach: A new framework for change management,"The actual change management models drawn from literature are focused only on the perspective of a single organisation. This perspective is not coherent with the new business scenario created by the pervasive use of digital technologies, which requires a new way to deal with organizational change. In particular, organizations have to manage change in a collaborative way, reflecting a progressive shift from a network to an ecosystem approach. Starting from this perspective, this paper aim to present a change on management framework in order to manage innovation within a complex digital ecosystem of actors. Coherently with this goal, the proposed framework will be articulated in a series of phases that have to be considered in the change process within an ecosystem. For each phase, the research will present the most common issues faced by organizations together with the corresponding change management actions. These actions are categorized in short-term and long-term. Moreover, the paper provides a set of indicators that can be used to monitor the effectiveness of the various change management actions. Finally, the validity of the change management framework will be proved thanks to its application in a project of digital innovation in healthcare domain. This analysis will provide a concrete example on how change management can be accomplished throughout a specific digital ecosystem.","Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2021-01-01,10.34190/EIE.21.077
Enhancing healthcare supply chain management through artificial intelligence-driven group decision-making with Sugeno–Weber triangular norms in a dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy context,"The healthcare industry faces numerous challenges in managing its supply chain efficiently, where critical decisions must be made promptly to ensure the availability of essential medical resources. This research introduces a novel artificial intelligence (AI) approach, utilizing the “Sugeno–Weber (SW) t-conorms and t-norms” (SWt-CNs&t-Ns) for decision-making in a Dual Hesitant q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy (DHq-ROF) context. The SWt-CNs&t-Ns are chosen for their adaptability in data unification, serving as prominent operations for union and intersection processes. Developing a set of fundamental operations is imperative to effectively utilize SWt-CNs&t-Ns and hybrid aggregation operators in DHq-ROF settings. Following the introduction of these processes, several aggregating operators have been provided. These operators include DHq-ROF SW weighted averaging, ordered weighted averaging, hybrid averaging, and their geometric counterparts utilizing DHq-ROF data. The SW triangular norm-based approach aggregates group preferences, facilitating a systematic decision-making process. Triangular norms ensure a realistic representation of interrelationships among decision criteria, leading to optimal healthcare supply chain management solutions. Furthermore, the SW triangular norm-based approach aggregates group preferences, enabling a systematic and comprehensive decision-making process. Choosing the best healthcare supply chain management solutions is easier when you use triangular norms because they give a more accurate picture of how the decision criteria affect each other. The effectiveness of the proposed AI framework is demonstrated through a series of experiments and case studies, showcasing its ability to enhance decision accuracy, reduce uncertainty, and improve overall supply chain performance. The research findings underscore the potential of AI-driven solutions to revolutionize healthcare supply chain management, ultimately leading to better resource allocation, cost efficiency, and improved patient care.",Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2024-09-01,10.1016/j.engappai.2024.108794
Towards flexible process support on mobile devices,"Ubiquitous computing is considered as enabler for linking everyday life with information and communication technology. However, developing pervasive and mobile applications that provide personalized user assistance still constitutes a challenge. Mobile application scenarios are diverse and encompass domains like healthcare, logistics, and sales. For their support two fundamental technologies with increasing maturity are emerging: development frameworks for mobile devices and light-weight process engines. Their integrated use, however, is in a rather premature state. Generally, the use of a process engine for supporting mobile collaboration raises many challenging issues. This paper picks up some of these challenges and shows how we have coped with them in the MARPLE project. MARPLE targets at a tight integration of process management technology with mobile computing frameworks in order to enable mobile process support in advanced application scenarios. We give insights into the MARPLE architecture and its components. In particular, we introduce the MARPLE process engine, which enables light-weight as well as flexible process support on mobile devices. This will be key for mobile user assistance in advanced application scenarios. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2011-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-17722-4_11
Support of the logistics chain by small aircraft in times of emergency,"Healthcare logistics, which is primarily aimed at patient care, represents a number of activities in the area of supply chain management. Hospitals are a key link in the supply chain, where they are the end customer, the supply chain from the manufacturer through all bottlenecks. A complete description of the distribution of medical supplies can be summarized into an external and internal supply chain. The external circuit represents the supply of the necessary commodities and ends at the distribution point. The internal circuit continues to the nursing units of the hospital supply chain. Currently, two basic forms are used for the distribution of supplies to the level of nursing units, through the regions, or through the supply from the humanitarian warehouse. The acquisition, storage, and distribution processes depend on the material availability on the market and the level of the maintained stocks. Modern technologies enable continuous collection of requirements and are the basis of a proactive approach to the solution, which allows the use of all accessible air transport, military and civilian capabilities, according to the criteria of the user or end customer.","NTinAD 2020 - New Trends in Aviation Development 2020 - 15th International Scientific Conference, Proceedings",2020-09-17,10.1109/NTAD51447.2020.9379077
Role-Framework of Artificial Intelligence in Combating the COVID-19 Pandemic,"COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (Corona) virus, first detected in China in December 2019 is now a worldwide pandemic due to its rapid spreading. People all over the world are fighting against it to combat the pandemic. Maintaining social aloofness and lockdowns can prevent the infection of COVID-19 but if this situation continues then the whole world must be confronted with economic catastrophe. Technology governed by artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising logistic that confirms its effectiveness for the benefits in different sectors like spread prediction, population screening, social awareness, hospital management, healthcare logistics, vaccine and drug delivery, surveillance and tracking, continuation of education and industrial production, etc. This article describes a framework of the role of AI in combating the effects of COVID-19 pandemic in dividing into nine sectors: i) Early trace-out, detection and diagnosis, ii) Disease surveillance, control, awareness build-up, and disease prevention, iii) Monitoring the treatment and predicting the risk of developing severe cases, iv) Screening and helping patients through chatbots, v) Service management through intelligence drones and robots, vi) Management of stress and the spread of rumors through social networks, vii) Understanding the virus through analysis of protein–protein interactions, viii) Speeding up the vaccine and drug discoveries and development, ix) Continuation of education and prediction of economic loss.

Drivers and Barriers to Implementing the Internet of Things in the Health Care Supply Chain: Mixed Methods Multicase Study,"Background: Over the past 2 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed enormous pressure on the health care industry. There has been an increase in demand and, at the same time, a shortage of supplies. This has shown that supply chain management in the health care industry cannot be taken for granted. Furthermore, the health care industry is also facing other major challenges, such as the current labor market shortage. In the literature, the Internet of Things (IoT) is highlighted as an effective tool to build a more resilient and efficient supply chain that can manage these challenges. Although using IoT in supply chain management has been extensively examined in other types of supply chains, its use in the health care supply chain has largely been overlooked. Given that the health care supply chain, compared to others, is more complex and is under growing pressure, a more in-depth understanding of the opportunities brought by IoT is necessary. Objective: This study aims to address this research gap by identifying and ranking the drivers of and barriers to implementing IoT in the health care supply chain. Methods: We conducted a 2-stage study. In the first, exploratory stage, a total of 12 semistructured interviews were conducted to identify drivers and barriers. In the second, confirmatory stage, a total of 26 health care supply chain professionals were asked in a survey to rank the drivers and barriers. Results: The results show that there are multiple financial, operational, strategy-related, and supply chain-related drivers for implementing IoT. Similarly, there are various financial, strategy-related, supply chain-related, technology-related, and user-related barriers. The findings also show that supply chain-related drivers (eg, increased transparency, traceability, and collaboration with suppliers) are the strongest drivers, while financial barriers (eg, high implementation costs and difficulties in building a business case) are the biggest barriers to overcome. Conclusions: The findings of this study add to the limited literature regarding IoT in the health care supply chain by empirically identifying the most important drivers and barriers to IoT implementation. The ranking of drivers and barriers provides guidance for practitioners and health care provider leaders intending to implement IoT in the health care supply chain.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,2023-01-01,10.2196/48730

A healthcare logistic network considering stochastic emission of contamination: Bi-objective model and solution algorithm,"This paper presents a novel healthcare waste location-routing problem by concentrating on a new perspective in healthcare logistics networks. In this problem, there are healthcare, treatment, and disposal centers. Locations of healthcare centers are known, however, it is required to select appropriate locations for treatment, recycling, and disposal centers. Healthcare wastes are divided into infectious and non-infectious wastes. Since a great volume of healthcare wastes are infectious, the emission of contamination can have obnoxious impacts on the environment. The proposed problem considers a stochastic essence for the emission of contamination which depends on the transferring times. In this respect, transferring times between healthcare and treatment centers have been considered as normal random variables. As transferring time increases, it is more likely for the contamination to spread. Having visited a treatment center, infectious wastes are sterilized and they will no longer be harmful to the environment. This research develops a bi-objective mixed-integer mathematical formulation to tackle this problem. The objectives of this model are minimization of total costs and emission of contamination, simultaneously. Complexity of the proposed problem led the researchers to another contribution. This study also develops a Multi-Objective Water-Flow like Algorithm (MOWFA), which is a meta-heuristic, to solve the problem. This algorithm uses a procedure based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to rank the non-dominated solutions in the archive set. By means of a developed mating operator, the MOWFA utilizes the best ranked solutions of the archive in order to obtain high quality offspring. Two neighborhood operators have been designed for the MOWFA as the local search methods. Extensive computational experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the MOWFA on several test problems compared with other meta-heuristics, namely the Multi-Objective Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (MOICA) and Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA). These experiments also include a real healthcare waste logistic network in Iran. The computational experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm prevails these algorithms in terms of some well-known performance evaluation measures.",Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,2020-10-01,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102060
Measuring the logistics performance of internal hospital supply chains – A literature study,"The patient care processes in hospitals are supported by a range of operational activities including inventory management and distribution of supplies to point-of-care locations. Hospitals carry large amounts and a great variety of items, and the issues of storing and distributing these items throughout the hospital supply chain are of great importance to providing high-quality patient service. Healthcare logistics encompasses the process of handling physical goods (e.g. pharmaceuticals, surgical medical products, medical equipment, sterile items, linen, food, etc.) and the associated information flows, from the reception of the goods within a hospital to their delivery at patient care locations. The medical supply costs constitute the second largest expenditure in hospitals, after personnel costs. A high-performing supply chain may realize improved outcomes (e.g. safe and quality patient service) and greater efficiency. Logistics managers need to identify opportunities to improve the logistics processes in order to lower costs and to improve patient care quality. However, in order to improve the logistics processes, you must understand how the healthcare supply chain is currently performing. Measuring the performance of the supply chain is fundamental to identify and address deficiencies in the logistics activities, and it serves as a good input for managerial decision-making. The purpose of this article is to present existing research on performance measurement at the internal hospital supply chain (e.g. inventory management, distribution activities), and more specifically in the operating theatre since it is among the most critical resources for a hospital. At the operating theatre, the requested items should be available at the right time at the right place, in the right condition, at the lowest cost possible. Furthermore, we will also discuss literature on multi-criteria decision-making techniques. It enables researchers to build a performance measurement framework and to prioritize between multiple performance indicators since a diverse group of stakeholders with conflicting interests is involved in the internal operating room supply chain.",Omega (United Kingdom),2019-01-01,10.1016/j.omega.2018.01.007

Hybrid Intelligent System for Medical Diagnosis in Health Care,"The autonomous city implies a global vision that incorporates artificial intelligence, deep learning, big data, decision-making, ICT and the Internet of Things (IoT) to promote sustainable development. The ageing issue is that researchers, companies and the government should devote efforts to developing smart health care, innovative technology and applications. For an extended period, conventional intelligence systems have played a critical role in health care. However, with the increased popularity and widespread use of these hybrid intelligent computer systems, there is a significant shift in the healthcare sector. Diagnosis and detection of various diseases using several techniques can be resolved by using these techniques. Different novel methods are applied to biomedical engineering to diagnose diseases, and new models are being studied and compared with the existing technologies. Hybrid intelligence systems can be implied in decision-making, remote monitoring, healthcare logistics, medical diagnosis, and modern information system. This success's fundamental cause seems to be derived by different intelligent computational mechanisms, such as genetic algorithms, evolutionary computation, convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), autoencoders, deep generative models and deep belief networks. To solve complex problems, we need domain knowledge that comprises the methodologies that provide hybrid systems with complementary reasoning and empirical data. This chapter will focus on the need for a hybrid intelligent system in the healthcare industry and their medical diagnosis applicability.",Intelligent Systems Reference Library,2021-01-01,10.1007/978-981-16-2972-3_2

Towards restraining cost in healthcare domain: A multiagent approach,"The proliferating cost with-in the healthcare domain is forcing the researchers and practitioners alike to revisit healthcare logistics domain again and again in order to control the cost. However, controlling healthcare cost requires that limits be placed either on prices, quantities of services or both. As prices can be easily controlled by effectively focusing on the mechanism rather then involving and arguing about the services. The prototype developed has directed its attention towards coordination and intelligence in order to effectively manage the logistics while aiming for the improvement of mechanism.

The iet in service industries,"Were you aware that consumers spend 60% of their dollars on services versus only 12% on durable goods? These statistics underscore data showing that in the past 10 years employment in manufacturing sector has declined from over 17% to just 11%, while employment in health care, logistics, and other service industries has risen from 13% to 17%. Recent articles in a wide variety of publications, discuss the carry-over of industrial engineering technology tools and techniques from manufacturing to the service industries. Industrial Engineering Technology courses focus on the goals of improving productivity, quality, and safety while reducing costs. Since these goals are suited to any industry, regardless of its economic sector, students in the Industrial Engineering Technology program are uniquely suited to transition from employment opportunities in manufacturing industries to employment opportunities in service enterprises. IET programs have always been known for maintaining excellence through innovative courses, class activities, and the exploration of new fields of opportunity. Now more than ever, IET programs need to expand their knowledge and use of service industry applications. As global competition continues to grow and U.S. service industries multiply, our IET graduates should be poised to meet the challenges unique to the service industries. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the changes necessary to enable IET programs to seriously integrate topics from healthcare, logistics, e-business, and other service industries into its core courses. It will also discuss how curricula changes will enhance students' skill set, increase the variety of their job opportunities upon graduation, and enable us to market our programs more effectively to a broader range of potential students in the future. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2006.","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2006-01-01,
