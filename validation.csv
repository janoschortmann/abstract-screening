The future of asset management,"Deming was famous for asking people, ""By What Method?"" an objective would be accomplished. Any useful concept has embedded in it the answer to that question. Asset Management, to be a valuable concept, must demonstrate a method that leads to success. The method should be inclusive of all the necessary elements, yet be simple to understand. We present a broader view of Asset Management here, built upon three core operating functions: Lead, Execute and Enable. The Execute function is always performed in the plant environment. Manufacturing success is relative to the competition however. Whoever can make the best products at the lowest cost will win. Lead and Enable are the great determinants of that relative success. In addition, Physical Asset Management has an identity crisis. Most practitioners use the term synonymously with the maintenance function. Asset Management's opportunity, however, goes beyond maintenance to be a guiding principal for all of manufacturing. This paper explores the four integrated facets of the Execute function in the plant: Capacity acquisition and disposition Production Asset Healthcare Logistics Our model, then, represents the Future of Asset Management, suggesting ""The Method"", necessary elements for successful manufacturing.","Proceedings of the 1st World Congress on Engineering Asset Management, WCEAM 2006",2006-01-01,10.1007/978-1-84628-814-2_50
A fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis approach for risk evaluation in healthcare logistics outsourcing: Case of Morocco,"Public–private partnerships in emerging countries are gradually considered a tool for growth development. One particular public–private partnership is that of outsourcing logistics in the healthcare sector. These partnerships provide several benefits for both private and public sectors but are generally associated with numerous risks that must be evaluated and subsequently managed. The aim in this paper is to develop a risk evaluation approach to rank risks when decision makers’ judgment is taken into consideration and where traditional risk evaluation techniques become less applicable. The proposed approach makes use of fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis methods since they are efficient techniques to rank alternatives based on selected evaluation criteria and can accommodate human judgment and preferences. The approach treats predetermined risks like alternatives, and evaluation criteria are represented by areas of impact of the risks. To validate the approach, we applied it to a real case of logistics outsourcing to private service providers in a Moroccan public pharmaceutical supply chain. The ranking results obtained show that the two methods lead to some differences in ranking but are highly correlated. The obtained results support healthcare policy makers in setting priorities to effectively deploy preventive and mitigation efforts.",Health Services Management Research,2020-08-01,10.1177/0951484820901668
Transporting COVID-19 testing specimens by routing unmanned aerial vehicles with range and payload constraints: the case of Istanbul,"This paper aims to emphasize the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic at the healthcare logistics and supply chain networks and to transport polymerase chain reaction testing samples between hospitals and laboratories by using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). To achieve the mission, range and payload capacitated UAV routing problem is defined and a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP) is developed. The MILP model aims to decide the requisite quantity of the UAVs and to minimize the total transportation distance while satisfying the predetermined constraints. As a real-life instance, the healthcare network of Istanbul is selected and the network includes 219 hospitals and 23-unit basic testing laboratories for the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicated that the proposed optimization model can find the needed number of UAVs with the minimum tour distances in reasonable run times and achieves to transport 25,000 testing specimens between hospitals and laboratories via UAVs.",Transportation Letters,2021-01-01,10.1080/19427867.2021.1896063
Reliable internet of things network architecture based on high altitude platforms,"Internet of Things (IoT) has become a hot topic of technical, social and economic significance in recent times. Projections on its impact are highly impressive, where over 100 billion of devices have been projected to be IoT connected with a global economic impact of more than $11 trillion by 2025. In this paper, we propose a reliable IoT network architecture based on high altitude platforms as an alternative standalone network that is well-positioned to provide seamless connectivity and coverage in remote areas. Potential applications of the proposed IoT network architecture are demonstrated in smart cities, healthcare, logistics, finance, agriculture and construction.","2019 Conference on Information Communications Technology and Society, ICTAS 2019",2019-04-30,10.1109/ICTAS.2019.8703519
Association of open communication and the emotional and behavioural impact of medical error on patients and families: state-wide cross-sectional survey,"Background How openly healthcare providers communicate after a medical error may influence long-term impacts. We sought to understand whether greater open communication is associated with fewer persisting emotional impacts, healthcare avoidance and loss of trust. Methods Cross-sectional 2018 recontact survey assessing experience with medical error in a 2017 random digit dial survey of Massachusetts residents. Two hundred and fifty-three respondents self-reported medical error. Respondents were similar to non-respondents in sociodemographics confirming minimal response bias. Time since error was categorised as <1, 1–2 or 3–6 years before interview. Open communication was measured with six questions assessing different communication elements. Persistent impacts included emotional (eg, sadness, anger), healthcare avoidance (specific providers or all medical care) and loss of trust in healthcare. Logistic regressions examined the association between open communication and long-term impacts. Results Of respondents self-reporting a medical error 3–6 years ago, 51% reported at least one current emotional impact; 57% reported avoiding doctor/facilities involved in error; 67% reported loss of trust. Open communication varied: 34% reported no communication and 24% reported ≥5 elements. Controlling for error severity, respondents reporting the most open communication had significantly lower odds of persisting sadness (OR=0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.60, p=0.006), depression (OR=0.16, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.77, p=0.022) or feeling abandoned/betrayed (OR=0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.48, p=0.004) compared with respondents reporting no communication. Open communication significantly predicted less doctor/facility avoidance, but was not associated with medical care avoidance or healthcare trust. Conclusions Negative emotional impacts from medical error can persist for years. Open communication is associated with reduced emotional impacts and decreased avoidance of doctors/facilities involved in the error. Communication and resolution programmes could facilitate transparent conversations and reduce some of the negative impacts of medical error.",BMJ Quality and Safety,2020-01-20,10.1136/bmjqs-2019-010367
Benchmarking of health technologies distribution models: An investigation of Lombardy’s local health authorities,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to develop a benchmarking framework for assessing the performance of the distribution models adopted by the local branches of National Health Services (NHSs) for delivering health technologies to patients at a local level, and to derive prescriptions for enhancing design and optimal management of the distribution models. Design/methodology/approach – The authors focussed the study on the distribution of absorbent devices for incontinence, adopting the analytic hierarchy process as a tool for developing the benchmarking framework. The authors applied the framework to the context of the Italian NHS with respect to the Lombard Local Health Authorities, assessing their performance in terms of operational efficiency and service quality. Findings – The developed framework constitutes a novel contribution, and it allows for generating prescriptions. Through its application to the context studied the authors found that a “one-size-fits-all” distribution model cannot be proposed, as regards both efficiency and effectiveness, since process standardization does not provide benefits or savings in all contexts. Rather, a total landed cost approach in the evaluation of the distribution practices must be adopted. Practical implications – This paper offers to managers and decision makers an innovative approach to the design of distribution models for health technologies. It provides policy makers with prescriptions to develop regulations fostering a comprehensive view of the factors for an optimal health technologies distribution at a local level. Originality/value – Given the dearth of scientific publications focussed on the distribution at the local level of health technologies, this paper significantly contributes to the existing body of knowledge and it offers an innovative framework which can be proficiently replicated in manifold contexts.",Benchmarking,2016-05-03,10.1108/BIJ-12-2013-0123
Healthcare logistics in disaster planning and emergency management: A perspective,"This paper discusses the role of healthcare supply chain management in disaster mitigation and management. While there is an abundance of literature examining emergency management and disaster preparedness efforts across an array of industries, little information has been directed specifically toward the emergency interface, interoperability and unconventional relationships among civilian institutions and the US Department of Defense (US DoD) or supply chain operations involved therein. To address this imbalance, this paper provides US DoD healthcare supply chain managers with concepts related to communicating and planning more effectively. It is worth remembering, however, that all disasters are local - under the auspice of tiered response involving federal agencies, the principal responsibility for responding to domestic disasters and emergencies rests with the lowest level of government equipped and able to deal with the incident effectively. As such, the findings are equally applicable to institutions outside the military. It also bears repeating that every crisis is unique: there is no such thing as a uniform response for every incident. The role of the US DoD in emergency preparedness and disaster planning is changing and will continue to do so as the need for roles in support of a larger effort also continues to change.",Journal of business continuity &amp; emergency planning,2017-12-01,
Investigating automation and AGV in healthcare logistics: a case study based approach,"In France, as in numerous countries, healthcare organisations are undergoing major transformations, leading them to rationalise their resources and optimize their flows. In this context, automation can play an important role, enabling value creation and patient satisfaction. Previous research has mainly focused on the technological aspects of automation, neglecting the organisational issues related to the implementation of this innovation and particularly the management of the hospital staff, including logistics personnel, involved within the organisational change process. The aim of this article is, at least, to partly address this gap within the literature, and to propose, based on an exploratory case study, an analysis grid of the challenges and changes in terms of logistics flows (pharmaceutical, waste, laundry, etc.) that impact staff involved in managing these flows in a hospital context. Our results highlight the importance and necessity of anticipating the building and deployment of new knowledge and skills in order to efficiently and effectively design and manage automated logistics flows with AGV system.",International Journal of Logistics Research and Applications,2019-05-04,10.1080/13675567.2018.1518414
Occupational safety and health and smaller organisations: Research challenges and opportunities,"Despite the prevalence of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and micro organisations, comparatively little is known about how such organisations approach occupational safety and health (OSH). Research has tended to present a negative picture of OSH practices in smaller organisations. This paper discusses some of the challenges to researching OSH in SMEs and micro organisations and how these challenges can be overcome. It draws lessons and experiences from a qualitative study involving 149 structured interviews, nine short-term ethnographies and 21 semi-structured interviews with owners and employees in SMEs and micro organisations from a broad cross-section of industry sectors in the UK, including construction, retail, healthcare, logistics and agriculture. Data from the study suggest that the established boundaries between micro, small and medium-sized enterprises are less meaningful in an OSH context – OSH practices are influenced more by the culture of the organisation, the type of work being undertaken and the sector that an organisation operates in. OSH practices in SMEs and micro organisations tend to reflect more informal characteristics of such organisations, with more emphasis (than many larger organisations) on tacit knowledge, learning by doing and improvisation. Such practices should not necessarily be assumed to be unsafe or incompatible with formalised OSH.",Policy and Practice in Health and Safety,2016-01-01,10.1080/14773996.2016.1239357
Socio-economic and corporate factors and COVID-19 pandemic: a wake-up call,"The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) emerges from the Chinese city Wuhan and its spread to the rest of the world, primarily affected economies and their businesses, leading to a global depression. The explanatory and cross-sectional regression approach assesses the impact of COVID-19 cases on healthcare expenditures, logistics performance index, carbon damages, and corporate social responsibility in a panel of 77 countries. The results show that COVID-19 cases substantially increase healthcare expenditures and decrease corporate social responsibility. On the other hand, an increase in the coronavirus testing capacity brings positive change in reducing healthcare expenditures, increased logistics activities, and corporate social responsibility. The cost of carbon emissions increases when corporate activities begin to resume. The economic affluence supports logistics activities and improves healthcare infrastructure. It linked to international cooperation and their assistance to supply healthcare logistics traded equipment through mutual trade agreements. The greater need to enhance global trade and healthcare logistics supply helps minimize the sensitive coronavirus cases that are likely to provide a safe and healthy environment for living.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,2021-11-01,10.1007/s11356-021-15275-6
"Enterprise IoT Modeling: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning","The Internet of Things (IoT)—the internetworking of physical devices—has been a significant advancement in recent decades and has been the catalyst for several other innovations. New Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platforms aim to solve the most complex challenge of manufacturers: consolidating all production systems into a single data model. They are used in smart cities, security and emergencies, environmental applications, energy, healthcare, logistics, industrial control, home automation, agriculture, and animal farming. These objects/devices/appliances can generate, collect, and exchange data without human-to-human or human-to-computer interactions. The IIoT is creating an explosion in structured and unstructured data from a growing army of sensors capable of registering locations, voices, faces, audio, temperature, sentiment, health, and others. Billions of IoT devices are interconnected and a huge volume of data is generated. Every device features automation to assist people in the planning, management, and decision-making of their day-to-day activities. Machine learning (ML) techniques are applied to further enhance the intelligence and capabilities of an application. Many researchers are interested in producing advanced IoT technology, combining ML and IoT Techniques. Through ML, IIoT devices learn to perform tasks such as predication, pattern recognition, classification, and clustering. To provide for a learning process, IoT devices are trained using various algorithms in ML and statistical models to analyze sample data. The various fields of data sets (structured and unstructured data) are characterized by measuring functional parameters. Later, ML algorithms are applied to the data set to find features, provide useful output, identify patterns or make decisions based on the data set, draw inferences from real-time data streams, make their results available to analysts, and embed their results directly in business processes. In ML, the real-time problem is classified by classification, clustering, regression models, and association rules. Based on the learning style, ML algorithms can be categorized as supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning.",EAI/Springer Innovations in Communication and Computing,2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-44407-5_3
Unlocking Solver Potential: A Framework for Analysis and Inter-Comparison of Optimisation Solvers,"Linear and mixed integer optimisation problems have demonstrated their strength in the field of (healthcare) logistics and supply chain management for years. However, real-world optimisation problems are complex in nature, and various mathematical programming solvers are leveraged to solve these problems today. With several advances in solver technologies in recent years, there has been growing interest in carrying out comparative evaluations of solvers for a range of applications. However, there appears a lack of guidance for decision makers to conduct solver performance assessment and inter-comparison. To address this gap, we aim to derive a framework of parameters deemed most relevant for evaluating and comparing different solvers for a given application. To this end, we perform a systematic literature review. The resulting parameters are classified into three core categories: performance metrics, stopping conditions, and performance enhancing elements of a solver.","International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2023: ""Rising like a Phoenix: Emerging from the Pandemic and Reshaping Human Endeavors with Digital Technologies""",2023-01-01,
Modeling healthcare logistics in a virtual world,"The 3D virtual world Second Life provides a free computing platform for to terraform virtual landscapes, build imaginative buildings or spaces, meet, socialize, and collaborate. Some universities and businesses have experimented with virtual classrooms and virtual stores. This article describes the beginnings of an experiment to use Second Life as a modeling platform for understanding pervasive computing in the domain of healthcare, specifically by building a ""hospital of the future,"" complete with virtual RFID for tracking and providing location-aware services, smart networked equipment, restocking robots and the beginnings of workflow automation for modeling many hospital business processes. The same technology could be used to optimize hospital supply chains, test technologies like RFID in a model before full scale deployment, educate and train personnel, and simulate applications in other domains like retail or battlefields.

Evaluation and Visualization of Blockchain-Based Healthcare,"Blockchain is a distributed ledger apparatus that utilizes timestamped blocks to manage and verify various transactions between two parties in a network with the help of cryptographic algorithms. As compared to popular opinion, blockchain not only serves as a backbone to cryptocurrencies but it can also serve as a pioneering solution to various disciplinary fields such as healthcare, logistics, and education. The approach taken by this chapter to tackle the various problems faced by the healthcare sector utilizes blockchain technology. It avails smart contracts as well as the decentralized nature of the blockchain and smart tokens to ensure smooth interactions between the patients and the physicians. Protection and maintaining the integrity of healthcare data without overlooking any security threats are the primary objectives of this chapter. This chapter discusses a model that uses a cloud-based decentralized model for the storage of patient data.",Futuristic Trends for Sustainable Development and Sustainable Ecosystems,2022-06-24,10.4018/978-1-6684-4225-8.ch010
Efficient estimation of a risk measure requiring two-stage simulation optimization,"This paper is concerned with the efficient estimation of the risk measure of a system where the estimation requires solving a two-stage simulation optimization problem. The first stage samples risk factors that specify a second stage simulation optimization problem. The second stage solves a simulation optimization problem and outputs the best performance of the system under the realized risk factors, which are then aggregated across all first stage samples to produce an estimate of the risk measure. Applications of such an estimation scheme arise frequently in important industries such as financial, healthcare, logistics, and manufacturing. Because a large number of first stage samples are typically needed, each of which requires solving a computationally expensive simulation optimization problem, the two-stage simulation optimization approach faces a major computational efficiency challenge. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes a sequential simulation budget allocation procedure that determines the allocation of simulation budget based on a score known as revised probability of sign change for each decision under each scenario. The consistency of the proposed procedure is proved and the computational efficiency gain of the proposed is demonstrated using both benchmark test functions and two test cases in the context of financial portfolio risk estimation and healthcare system resilience estimation.",European Journal of Operational Research,2023-03-16,10.1016/j.ejor.2022.06.028
Towards flexible process support on mobile devices,"Ubiquitous computing is considered as enabler for linking everyday life with information and communication technology. However, developing pervasive and mobile applications that provide personalized user assistance still constitutes a challenge. Mobile application scenarios are diverse and encompass domains like healthcare, logistics, and sales. For their support two fundamental technologies with increasing maturity are emerging: development frameworks for mobile devices and light-weight process engines. Their integrated use, however, is in a rather premature state. Generally, the use of a process engine for supporting mobile collaboration raises many challenging issues. This paper picks up some of these challenges and shows how we have coped with them in the MARPLE project. MARPLE targets at a tight integration of process management technology with mobile computing frameworks in order to enable mobile process support in advanced application scenarios. We give insights into the MARPLE architecture and its components. In particular, we introduce the MARPLE process engine, which enables light-weight as well as flexible process support on mobile devices. This will be key for mobile user assistance in advanced application scenarios. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2011-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-17722-4_11
Optimized Workflow for the Healthcare Logistic: Case of the Pediatric Emergency Department,"The Emergency Department (ED) in a hospital, as its name implies, is a facility to be utilized by those who require emergency medical care. This paper introduces the longitudinal organization of the patient handling"" in the Pediatric Emergency called the ""Pediatric Emergency Path"". This work discusses the usability of the workflow approach in order to design the patient path in the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) in order to thwart the care complexity scheme. The goal is to optimize these paths to improve the quality of the patient handling while mastering the wait time. The development of this model was based on accurate visits made in the PED of the Regional University Hospital Center (CHRU) of Lille (France). This modeling, which has to represent most faithfully possible the reality of the PED of CHRU of Lille, is necessary. It must be enough retailed to produce an analysis allowing to identify the dysfunctions of the PED and also to propose and to estimate prevention indicators of tensions.

Mathematical model and exact algorithm for the home care worker scheduling and routing problem with lunch break requirements,"Home health care or home care (HHC/HC) refers to the delivery of social, medical and paramedical services to clients in their own homes. Each day, care workers start from the HHC/HC centre, visit some clients and return to the centre. During the service delivery process, there is usually a lunch break for each worker. In this paper, we address a real-life home care worker scheduling and routing problem with the consideration of lunch break requirements. A three-index mathematical model is constructed for the problem. The problem is decomposed into a master problem and several pricing sub-problems, and is optimally solved by a branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm. Specifically, a sophisticated label-correcting algorithm is designed to address lunch break constraints in pricing sub-problems; some cutting-edge acceleration strategies are applied during the column generation process. Experimental results show that the proposed B&P algorithm is able to produce satisfied solutions within an acceptable runtime and outperforms the mixed integer programming solver CPLEX.",International Journal of Production Research,2017-01-17,10.1080/00207543.2016.1213917
Factors impacting technology adoption in hospital bed logistics,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to refine and expand technology adoption theory for a healthcare logistics setting by combining the technology–organization–environment framework with a business process management (BPM) perspective. The paper identifies and ranks factors impacting the decision to implement instances of technologies in healthcare logistics processes. Design/methodology/approach: A multiple case study is carried out at five Danish hospitals to investigate the bed logistics process. A combined technology adoption and BPM lens is applied to gain an understanding of the reasoning behind technology adoption. Findings: A set of 17 factors impacting the adoption of technologies within healthcare logistics was identified. The impact factors perceived as most important to the adoption of technologies in healthcare logistics processes relate to quality, employee work conditions and employee engagement. Research limitations/implications: This paper seeks to understand how managers can use knowledge about impact factors to improve processes through technology adoption. The findings of this study provide insights about the factors impacting the adoption of technologies in healthcare logistics processes. Differences in perceived importance of factors enable ranking of impact factors, and prioritization of changes to be implemented. The study is limited to five hospitals, but is expected to be representative of public hospitals in developed countries and applicable to similar processes.

A case study: Application of network clock model to heterogeneous sensor networks,"A sensor network consists of sensor nodes that have sensing, computation and wireless communication capabilities. There are various sensor network applications, including disaster relief operations, environmental monitoring and control, precision agriculture, intelligent home and buildings, facility management, machine surveillance and preventive maintenance, medicine and healthcare, logistics, telematics, and others. Many of these applications share some basic functionalities, namely event detection, periodic measurement and tracking, all of which entail collecting and forwarding of event data. For the purposes of triggering an action, it is necessary to know when an event occurs. Certainly time is an essential factor in many sensor network applications. This paper proposes, based on a cast study, a network clock model application to heterogeneous sensor networks. The network clock model is a scheme by which a consistent notion of time can be shared among sensor networks’ devices in order to enable the combination of time and data for applications.

Technological implementation in the service sector: A case study,"The service industry is a crucial industry recognized as the biggest of the three sectors of the economy. Implementing technology in this industry has been the driving force for industrial advancement. In contrast, this industry's disproportionate adoption of technology explains the disparity between developing and developed worlds. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been recognized as the newest technology disrupting and driving innovation in the service industry, with the quest for superior business experience and customer service driving its adoption. However, AI is not the only technology driving transformations in the service industry but also a constituent of innovative technologies, such as search, chatbots, cloud computing, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), mobile, social, and the IoT. In addition, this chapter advocates for the fourth component of cloud computing to be named diversity as a service (DaaS). Technology is the most significant enabler of globalization. Globalization is the most fantastic driver of diversities-creating opportunities, virtual, and physical, for people from different cultural, religious, racial, geographical, and other backgrounds to interact. However, this confluence of diversities is leading to unsavory human experiences giving rise to racial protests, gender inequalities, underrepresentation of ethnic minorities, and others. However, implementing technology in diversity management could be the elixir to these problems. The chapter seeks to explore the implications of technology implementation in the service industry to ascertain whether the economic impact of technology in the service industry influences its adoption and how to encourage technology adoption in the service industry. The chapter also analyzes whether technology implementation in the service sector is economical to provide organizations with a decision-making tool for further exploring the industry and making experimental projections of technology's prognosis in the service industry to encourage research and scientific activity. This is because many or most of the literature on AI are projections, simulations, and assumptions emphasizing how the implementation of AI will increase unemployment and change the labor landscape in ways that may not be familiar to many. We adapted the core generalizations from some of these reports to evaluate these projections. Academic and research reports from the sciences, engineering, and medicine on information technology (IT) and the U.S. workforce into an analytical framework because it embodies the core assumptions of most of the literature on the subject. We then used the analytical framework to analyze secondary data from those who have implemented these technologies to see whether the implementation of technology in the service sector was economical or not and whether economic factors affected the adoption of the technology. Finally, we explored possible extensions of existing knowledge as experimental projections to encourage further research. Furthermore, the chapter explored three critical sectors of the service industry as case studies, including the Healthcare, Logistics, and Entertainment sectors, and attempted an economic analysis of the implementation of technology in these sectors and projected experimental investigation of the consequences of implementing technology in these sectors in the future. It was noticed that the implementation of technology in the service industry is gaining increased adoption with signs of growing adoption into the future. Economically, the performance of technology increases productivity, lowers costs, and transforms the way work is done and changes the labor landscape, with machines gaining greater involvement and acceptance as co-workers with human counterparts. This shows the economic benefits of implementing technology in the service sector in increasing its adoption. Most importantly, it was established that different levels of education, not technology, are the causes of income inequalities. Generally, the implementation of technology increases the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery in these sectors, leading to labor efficiency, increased productivity, and cost-effectiveness. Experimentally, the chapter projects that we are entering the era of flying cargoes and rocket-like cargo ships. The chapter concludes with claims that though machines will see greater adoption in the entertainment industry, they will not substitute human creativity in serving entertainment, and humans will always cherish entertainment served by humans and treat machine-generated entertainment as fiction.",Artificial Intelligence for Smart Technology in the Hospitality and Tourism Industry,2024-07-05,
