Towards restraining cost in healthcare domain: A multiagent approach,"The proliferating cost with-in the healthcare domain is forcing the researchers and practitioners alike to revisit healthcare logistics domain again and again in order to control the cost. However, controlling healthcare cost requires that limits be placed either on prices, quantities of services or both. As prices can be easily controlled by effectively focusing on the mechanism rather then involving and arguing about the services. The prototype developed has directed its attention towards coordination and intelligence in order to effectively manage the logistics while aiming for the improvement of mechanism. Coordination and user profiling has been demonstrated in multi agent environment. The idea here is to order medicines using human expertise in the form of fuzzy logics and effective coordination of different hospital pharmacies for an efficient use of medicines.",Innovation and Knowledge Management in Business Globalization: Theory and Practice - Proceedings of the 10th International Business Information Management Association Conference,2008-01-01,
Fleet sizing and routing of healthcare automated guided vehicles,"This paper proposes techniques to improve the efficiency of transportation activities within hospitals. Transportation is a major activity in hospitals which requires management efforts to improve its efficiency and increase the quality of patient services. One of the most powerful ways of achieving more efficiency of transportation systems in hospitals is via the labor-saving technology of logistics processes using automated guided vehicles (AGVs). In this paper, we study the fleet sizing and routing problem with synchronization for AGVs with dynamic demands (FSRPS-AGV) in the context of a real-life application. The goal is to simultaneously optimize the number and types of carts and AGVs needed to perform all daily requests in a hospital while optimizing AGVs’ routes and respecting time constraints. Different requests require different types of carts, which are transported by the AGVs. Each request is composed of several tasks consisting of moving material from a pickup point to a delivery point. Operation synchronization among the tasks of the same request (task 1 must be performed before task 2, possibly by different AGVs but using the same cart) and movement synchronization with respect to AGVs and carts (an AGV may drop off a cart, and later another AGV picks up the cart to continue serving the same or another request) are major challenges of the addressed problem. In this paper, we describe, model, and solve the FSRPS-AGV. We introduce a mathematical formulation and propose a powerful matheuristic based on a fast and efficient dynamic reoptimization of the routes upon the arrival of new requests. We compare the performance of our matheuristic under different scenarios, including against the solutions obtained by an oracle, showing that it can handle dynamism of demand very well and achieve near-optimal solutions. We assess our methods using small and large instances generated based on real data from an industrial partner. We demonstrate that significant performance improvements and important savings can be achieved with a small degree of flexibility in timing constraints and less conservative speed estimations (while taking into account safety concerns). Finally, we provide managerial insights with respect to the number of AGVs and carts that should be acquired by our industrial partner.",Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,2022-05-01,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102679
Navigating uncertain distribution problem: a new approach for resolution optimization of transportation with several objectives under uncertainty,"Amidst uncertainty, decision-making in manufacturing becomes a central focus due to its complexity. This study explores complex transportation constraints and uses novel ways to guide manufacturers. The Multi-objective Stochastic Linear Fractional Transportation Problem (MOSLFTP) is a crucial tool for managing supply chains, manufacturing operations, energy distribution, emergency routes, healthcare logistics, and other related areas. It adeptly addresses uncertainty, transforming efficiency and effectiveness in several domains. Stochastic programming is the process of converting theoretical probabilities into concrete certainties. The artistic compromise programming technique acts as a proficient mediator, reconciling opposing objectives and enabling equitable decision-making. This novel approach also addresses the Multi-objective Stochastic Linear plus Linear Fractional Transportation Problem (MOSLPLFTP), which involves two interconnected issues. The effectiveness of these principles is clearly shown with the help of the LINGO® 18 optimization solver. This study uses a ranking method to compare the similar methods to solve the current problems. A meticulously designed example acts as a significant achievement, shedding light on our method in a practical setting. It serves as a distinctive instrument, leading manufacturers through the maze of uncertainty and assisting them in determining the most advantageous course of action. This journey involves subtle interactions between complexity and simplicity, uncertainty is overcome by decisiveness, and invention is predominant.",Frontiers in Mechanical Engineering,2024-01-01,10.3389/fmech.2024.1389791
Socio-economic and corporate factors and COVID-19 pandemic: a wake-up call,"The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) emerges from the Chinese city Wuhan and its spread to the rest of the world, primarily affected economies and their businesses, leading to a global depression. The explanatory and cross-sectional regression approach assesses the impact of COVID-19 cases on healthcare expenditures, logistics performance index, carbon damages, and corporate social responsibility in a panel of 77 countries. The results show that COVID-19 cases substantially increase healthcare expenditures and decrease corporate social responsibility. On the other hand, an increase in the coronavirus testing capacity brings positive change in reducing healthcare expenditures, increased logistics activities, and corporate social responsibility. The cost of carbon emissions increases when corporate activities begin to resume. The economic affluence supports logistics activities and improves healthcare infrastructure. It linked to international cooperation and their assistance to supply healthcare logistics traded equipment through mutual trade agreements. The greater need to enhance global trade and healthcare logistics supply helps minimize the sensitive coronavirus cases that are likely to provide a safe and healthy environment for living.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,2021-11-01,10.1007/s11356-021-15275-6
Selective vehicle routing for a mobile blood donation system,"In this study, a mobile blood collection system is designed with the primary objective of increasing blood collection levels. This design also takes into account operational costs to aim for collection of large amounts of blood at reasonable cost. Bloodmobiles perform direct tours to certain activities to collect blood, but at the end of each day, they bring the collected blood to a designated depot to prevent its spoilage. The proposed system consists of the bloodmobiles and a new vehicle called the shuttle that visits the bloodmobiles in the field on each day and transfers the collected blood to the depot. Consequently, bloodmobiles can continue their tours without having to make daily returns to the depot. We propose a mathematical model and a 2-stage IP based heuristic algorithm to determine the tours of the bloodmobiles and the shuttle, and their lengths of stay at each stop. This new problem is defined as an extension of the Selective Vehicle Routing Problem and is referred to as the SVRP with Integrated Tours. The performances of the solution methodologies are tested first on a real data set obtained from past blood donation activities of Turkish Red Crescent in Ankara, and then on a constructed data set based on GIS data of the European part of Istanbul. The Pareto set of optimum solutions is generated based on blood amounts and logistics costs, and finally a sensitivity analysis on some important design parameters is conducted.",European Journal of Operational Research,2015-08-16,10.1016/j.ejor.2015.03.007

Medrone,"In order to address the pressing healthcare challenges faced by isolated communities in remote regions, this project proposes the development of an innovative Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a focus on autonomous navigation, advanced object detection, and collision avoidance systems for efficient and reliable delivery of life-saving medicines and equipment. The UAV will be equipped with autonomous navigation capabilities, allowing it to operate without direct human intervention. This is particularly crucial in regions lacking proper infrastructure, where manual control may be impractical. The autonomous system will utilize GPS technology to ensure precise navigation and route planning, optimizing the efficiency of medical deliveries. To enhance the UAV's capability to operate in unpredictable environments, object detection systems will be integrated. This technology will enable the UAV to identify and navigate around obstacles such as trees, buildings, or uneven terrain. Utilizing a combination of cameras and ultrasonic sensors, the UAV will continuously scan its surroundings, making real-time decisions to avoid collisions and ensure a safe and reliable delivery path. The UAV's collision avoidance system will go beyond simple obstacle detection by actively predicting potential collision scenarios and taking preventive measures. This real-time decision-making process will be essential for navigating through challenging geographical landscapes like mountains and forests. In addition to its navigation and obstacle avoidance capabilities, the UAV will be equipped with a package deployment mechanism. This system will allow for the precise and controlled release of medical supplies at designated delivery points, ensuring that essential resources reach their intended destinations accurately and safely. By combining these cutting-edge technologies, the proposed UAV aims to revolutionize healthcare logistics in hard-to-reach areas, providing timely and efficient delivery of medical supplies to communities in need. This project not only addresses the immediate healthcare challenges but also contributes to the overall improvement of public health in isolated regions, promoting the well-being of women and the elderly who are disproportionately affected by the lack of accessible medical care.","Proceedings of ICWITE 2024: IEEE International Conference for Women in Innovation, Technology and Entrepreneurship",2024-01-01,10.1109/ICWITE59797.2024.10503579

Healthcare logistics &amp; supply chain management in health industry of Indonesia based on the telemedicine,"The essential mission of logistics and supply chain management is to efficiently plan, organize, and coordinate the movement of goods from a point of origin to a point of consumption. Analyzing and aligning supply chain goals with a patient-first approach enables healthcare organizations to reduce costs while improving patient outcomes. With Patient Direct, a care delivery solution from HRS, this paper provides patients with the telehealth equipment they need when they need it by telemedicine. Telemedicine which is used interchangeably with the term telehealth is the remote delivery of healthcare to patients through information and communication technology, including communication between two or more health professionals who are not in the same location. Thus, it needs secure transmission of medical data through text, sound, image, or video. This system can be a tele-education, tele-monitoring, tele-consultation, or tele-intervention. Telemedicine has several benefits, both for health professionals and medical institution as well as for the patients, especially for the development of healthcare delivery in remote area and also to make interaction between healthcare professional faster. However, telemedicine still has lack of regulation in Indonesia. There is still no regulation about license for the health professional and safety of medical data. Ethical problems in telemedicine are also still an issue, especially about patient's confidentiality, and also it can weaken doctor-patients relationship. According code of ethics, a doctor must examine the patients first before making a diagnosis and treatment, which cannot be done with telemedicine. The lack of regulation and ethical consideration make telemedicine in Indonesia still has some problems and need a challenge for improvement.",International Journal of Supply Chain Management,2020-01-01,

The concept has been successful in those areas, and this study aims to show the same. This paper utilized the Six Sigma DMAIC methodology to improve the quality and application consumption of the Methyl Methacrylate (MMA)-Based Elastomeric Membrane used in major infrastructure and building construction. The utilization of the DMAIC methodology involves a case study on how to enhance and improve the consumption rate of the membrane, adhesion of the membrane to the substrate, thickness level of the membrane, and reduce the pinholes occurring to the system.",ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2022-06-15,10.1145/3545897.3545918
Healthcare service modeling to minimize disruptions due to natural disasters,"The aftermath of any disaster could be enormous and annihilating especially for healthcare industry. In case of an emergency, the healthcare organizations in the affected region may experience out of stock situation for medical supplies which eventually impact their services. Healthcare providers need to replenish their supplies from central distribution centers or unaffected regional distribution centers. The most difficult situation that authorities face is the complexity of operating conditions where they had to work in order to supply medical items to the affected region from a central position. Some regions may be very difficult to reach under disaster condition. In this scenario it may be required to share medical items from contiguous health care organizations. Operations Research techniques have already been proven to be beneficial for different planning situations, mainly during the preparation and the response phase of disaster life cycle. There are very few works that have been done in the field of inventory relocation in case of a disaster. This paper discusses the modeling techniques to minimize the stock out situation of medical supplies in the natural disaster affected zones.",IIE Annual Conference and Expo 2013,2013-01-01,
Implementation of a new echocardiographic practice during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Due to the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, healthcare logistics have changed abruptly and significantly in all medical specialties, of which cardiovascular services are no exception. Assessment of urgent and priority cases did not stop, both medical personnel and patients required adaptation of personal protective measures to prevent the spread of a highly contagious and potentially fatal virus for this vulnerable population with cardiovascular disease. In the time that has elapsed since the beginning of said pandemic to date, the health sector has become immersed in a fortuitous and challenging situation for its work environment. Considering that this virus could remain endemic, it is necessary to devise a protocol for a gradual and safe reincorporation of services at all levels of care. This document provides an update on recommendations for the return to a safe but no less efficient echocardiographic practice, based on expert opinions, some international guidelines along with evidence available until recently on several main echocardiographic findings in patients with cardiovascular disease by COVID-19, providing a general approach that can be adapted to the guidelines of each health institution in this country.",Cardiovascular and Metabolic Science,2020-10-01,10.35366/97548
Transportation-Induced Carbon Emissions Jeopardize Healthcare Logistics Sustainability: Toward a Healthier Today and a Better Tomorrow,"Background: Logistics operations are considered essential for transporting commodities from one location to another, helping to promote global economic activity. On the other hand, its negative impact eclipses its positive impact, namely the rise in healthcare expenditures due to its ecological footprint. Globally, rising out-of-pocket health expenses result from logistic-induced carbon emissions, posing a danger to the long-term viability of healthcare. Methods: Based on this critical fact, this study examined the impact of logistics operations on healthcare costs by controlling for carbon emissions, fuel imports, and economic development across a large cross-section of 131 nations by using the Robust Least Squares Regression. Results: The findings demonstrate a U-shaped association between logistical operations and healthcare expenditures, i.e., if there is a 1% increase in logistics operations, healthcare expenditures decrease by −2.421% initially, while at later stages, healthcare costs would increase by 0.139%. On the other hand, increased fuel imports and economic growth due to logistics activities are increasing healthcare expenditures with an elasticity estimate of 0.087% and 0.147%, respectively. According to the forecasting predictions, logistics-induced carbon emissions, fuel imports, and economic expansion will increase healthcare expenses. Conclusions: A sustainable logistics operation is critical for strengthening healthcare infrastructure and meeting the global carbon neutrality goal.",Logistics,2022-06-01,10.3390/logistics6020027
The case for healthcare supply chain management: Insights from problem-solving approaches,"The US healthcare industry is a large enterprise accounting for over 14.1% of the national economic output in 2001. It has been under pressure for cost containment and providing quality healthcare services to consumers. Its record of investing heavily in the development of sophisticated drugs and diagnostic systems does not match that of technologies to manage its day-to-day operations. In order to achieve improved performance, the healthcare supply chain must be efficient and integrated. The driver for this integration is logistics and supply chain management. This paper describes trends, issues and some solutions for logistics management for the healthcare supply chain with concepts drawn from industrial engineering, and operations research disciplines applied to specific domains.

Sustainable and Robust Home Healthcare Logistics: A Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Today, research on healthcare logistics is an important challenge in developing and developed countries, especially when a pandemic such as COVID-19 occurs. The responses required during such a pandemic would benefit from an efficiently designed model for robust and sustainable healthcare logistics. In this study, we focus on home healthcare logistics and services for planning the routing and scheduling of caregivers to visit patients’ homes. Due to the need for social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, these services are highly applicable for reducing the growth of the epidemic. In addition to this challenge, home healthcare logistics and services must be redesigned to meet the standards of a triple bottom line approach based on sustainable development goals. A triple bottom line approach finds a balance between economic, environmental, and social criteria for making a sustainable decision. Although, recently, the concept of green home healthcare has been studied based on the total cost and green emissions of home healthcare logistics and services, as far as we know, no research has been conducted on the formulation of a triple bottom line approach for home healthcare logistics and services. To achieve social justice for caregivers, the goal of balancing working time is to find a balance between unemployment time and overtime. Another contribution of this research is to develop a scenario-based robust optimization approach to address the uncertainty of home healthcare logistics and services and to assist with making robust decisions for home healthcare planning. Since our multi-objective optimization model for sustainable and robust home healthcare logistics and services is more complex than other studies, the last novel contribution of this research is to establish an efficient heuristic algorithm based on the Lagrangian relaxation theory. An initial solution is found by defining three heuristic algorithms. Our heuristic algorithms use a symmetric pattern for allocating patients to pharmacies and planning the routing of caregivers. Then, a combination of the epsilon constraint method and the Lagrangian relaxation theory is proposed to generate high-quality Pareto-based solutions in a reasonable time period. Finally, an extensive analysis is done to show that our multi-objective optimization model and proposed heuristic algorithm are efficient and practical, as well as some sensitivities are studied to provide some managerial insights for achieving sustainable and robust home healthcare services in practice.",Symmetry,2022-02-01,10.3390/sym14020193
Hybrid Intelligent System for Medical Diagnosis in Health Care,"The autonomous city implies a global vision that incorporates artificial intelligence, deep learning, big data, decision-making, ICT and the Internet of Things (IoT) to promote sustainable development. The ageing issue is that researchers, companies and the government should devote efforts to developing smart health care, innovative technology and applications. For an extended period, conventional intelligence systems have played a critical role in health care. However, with the increased popularity and widespread use of these hybrid intelligent computer systems, there is a significant shift in the healthcare sector. Diagnosis and detection of various diseases using several techniques can be resolved by using these techniques. Different novel methods are applied to biomedical engineering to diagnose diseases, and new models are being studied and compared with the existing technologies. Hybrid intelligence systems can be implied in decision-making, remote monitoring, healthcare logistics, medical diagnosis, and modern information system. This success's fundamental cause seems to be derived by different intelligent computational mechanisms, such as genetic algorithms, evolutionary computation, convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), autoencoders, deep generative models and deep belief networks. To solve complex problems, we need domain knowledge that comprises the methodologies that provide hybrid systems with complementary reasoning and empirical data. This chapter will focus on the need for a hybrid intelligent system in the healthcare industry and their medical diagnosis applicability.",Intelligent Systems Reference Library,2021-01-01,10.1007/978-981-16-2972-3_2
Simulation optimization for the inventory management of healthcare supplies,"This article covers the inventory management of healthcare supplies problem. Based on the mathematical programming model set out by [1], a causal model and a flow chart were developed to outline the simulation model, which was to be later applied to a highly specialized medical institution that performs high-risk heart surgery, such as catheterizations and angioplasties. With this simulation model, a purchases plan with 21 healthcare supplies was obtained that contemplates all the problem’s restrictions: purchasing policy (safety stock, available budget); the warehouse’s physical reality (warehouse capacity); characteristics of supplies (useful life, service level); and suppliers (price, capacity and size of lots or rounding value). Different indicators were also considered, such as service levels, costs of purchases, stockouts costs and inventory maintenance costs. The results obtained with the simulation model came very close to the mathematical programming results, but the computing times were considerably shorter.",International Journal of Simulation Modelling,2020-06-01,10.2507/IJSIMM19-2-514
Home healthcare in Spanish rural areas: Applying vehicle routing algorithms to health transport management,"Depopulation of rural areas poses a range of new challenges for the provision of public services. Access to primary care centres is essential for promoting and protecting quality of life, especially for the older population. However, many rural municipalities face abandonment from public administrations by not even having a local clinic and forcing their dwellers to drive to the nearest facility. This research examines the adequacy of providing home healthcare (HHC) systems in such areas to avoid unnecessary trips. When designing routes to provide these services, decision-makers must take into account the following: (i) wide geographical spread of places to visit; (ii) difficulty in accessing some of these places with heavy medically equipped vehicles; and (iii) uncertainty regarding places to visit and availability of professionals. Our study identifies municipalities in which the travelling distance to the closest centre is above a desirable threshold, estimating the magnitude of the problem. Then, we provide an illustrative example in which an agile methodology is presented to design efficient routes that allow policymakers to offer HHC services of reasonable quality.",Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,2024-04-01,10.1016/j.seps.2024.101828
Support of the logistics chain by small aircraft in times of emergency,"Healthcare logistics, which is primarily aimed at patient care, represents a number of activities in the area of supply chain management. Hospitals are a key link in the supply chain, where they are the end customer, the supply chain from the manufacturer through all bottlenecks. A complete description of the distribution of medical supplies can be summarized into an external and internal supply chain. The external circuit represents the supply of the necessary commodities and ends at the distribution point. The internal circuit continues to the nursing units of the hospital supply chain. Currently, two basic forms are used for the distribution of supplies to the level of nursing units, through the regions, or through the supply from the humanitarian warehouse. The acquisition, storage, and distribution processes depend on the material availability on the market and the level of the maintained stocks. Modern technologies enable continuous collection of requirements and are the basis of a proactive approach to the solution, which allows the use of all accessible air transport, military and civilian capabilities, according to the criteria of the user or end customer.","NTinAD 2020 - New Trends in Aviation Development 2020 - 15th International Scientific Conference, Proceedings",2020-09-17,10.1109/NTAD51447.2020.9379077
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Adaptation to Facilitate Healthcare Supply Chains in Low-Income Countries,"Low-income countries are persistently suffering from last-mile logistics issues in healthcare supply chains. Therefore, it is high time to explore technological applications to overcome such inadequacies. The faster speed, low maintenance cost, and absence of road dependency in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have popularized them as an alternative to road delivery. Hence, it is suggested as a solution to overcome the persisting distribution inefficiencies in healthcare logistics of low-income countries. According to the case study analysis conducted on the Sri Lankan vaccine cold chain, incorporating UAVs increases truck-space utilization and reduces the time consumed, cost incurred, and carbon dioxide emission in a delivery round. Moreover, the most suitable way to cover the initial setup cost of an unmanned aerial system (UAS) is by receiving aid from international donors. The capital cost also can be covered by government investments or via service outsourcing only if the number of flights per year is increased. Moreover, a homogenous (i.e., only UAV) solution was revealed to be more beneficial than a heterogeneous (i.e., truck and UAV) solution. However, due to the lack of technology literacy and willingness to change in low-income countries, it is recommended to initially execute a heterogeneous solution and expand to a homogeneous plan in the future years. However, it was evident that for a mixed-fleet solution to be advantageous, drone characteristics play a vital role. Hence, a UAV with specifications ideal for the use case must be utilized to garner the maximum benefits. Nevertheless, it was apparent that with the right implementation plan, UAVs possess the potential to overcome the shortcomings in the healthcare logistics of low-income countries.",Drones,2022-11-01,10.3390/drones6110321
A Pattern Adherence Analysis to a Blockchain Web Application,"Blockchain is an emerging technology that is attracting a lot of attention from both academia and industry. Blockchain when used as a decentralized technology could be utilized in various useful applications, such as healthcare, logistics, supply chain management, education, among others. However, there is the integration factor between technologies and environments, which have their own characteristics and challenges. A pattern is a solution with reusable fetures for a problem that commonly occurs in a given context during software design phases. Usually, when adopting a design pattern, there are trade-offs among quality attributes. In this context, using patterns can promote a better use for blockchain in traditional application and system development, and disseminate best practices. The aim of this paper is to analyze a traditional web application that uses blockchain features from the viewpoint of some patterns, specifically patterns that describe the blockchain integration with the outside world. As a result, we found that applying blockchain patterns can benefit systems, especially those that require integration with other systems, such as legacy or existing.","Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture Companion, ICSA-C 2020",2020-03-01,10.1109/ICSA-C50368.2020.00028
