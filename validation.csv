The applications of 5G-enabled IoT range to all society segments, such as industry, agriculture, environment, traffic, healthcare, logistics, and many more. Thus, it comes up as a good topic to research and makes the masses aware of it. The scale by which human lives will be made more accessible, productive, secure, and healthy and the need for this to be brought forward by the masses serve as the motivation for this chapter. In this chapter, we describe 5G-enabled IoT and its importance in the modern industries. It should detail upon applications of 5G-enabled IoT, which are assumed to bring revolutions like smart cities, advanced healthcare, smart homes, automated agriculture, autonomous vehicles, intelligent supply chain management, and how all the applications will reduce cost and labor. We shall also briefly touch upon some of the disadvantages and some rumors of the upcoming fifth generation of the Internet, making the people stand against these modern technologies' uprise. 5G is the fifth generation of wireless technology. It is meant to provide very high data transfer speeds and more reliable networks, seamlessly connect a massive number of embedded sensors, and provide extremely low-cost connectivity solutions. The Internet of Things is a system of computing devices, sensors, etc. which are connected via the Internet and can communicate with each other, i.e., transfer data without any human intervention. However, with the advent of 5G, IoT is meant to go through revolutionary changes. 5G will enable us to remotely control a more significant number of devices and allow data transfers at benchmark speeds in applications where real-time network performance is critical. Thus, 5G will bring out the full potential of IoT. 5G-enabled IoT will leave a lasting expression in fields of automation, machine intelligence, and smart systems. As mentioned above, domains like smart cities, autonomous vehicles, automated factories, intelligent machine tools, augmented and virtual reality, healthcare, etc. are going to experience substantial technological advancements with the advent of 5G-enabled IoT systems. Innovation in the automation industry would boom as they have increased the use of IoT to connect cars, connecting with traffic and road services, etc. This vast increase in connected devices requires a superior network to manage it in overall speed, capacity, and latency. In these areas, 5G is set to make a significant improvement over current 4G LTE standards.",Blockchain for 5G-Enabled IoT: The new wave for Industrial Automation,2021-04-09,10.1007/978-3-030-67490-8_18
Digital innovation and the future of work,"The concept of digitalization captures the widespread adoption of digital technologies in our lives, in the structure and functioning of organizations and in the transformation of our economy and society. Digital technologies for data processing and communication underly high-impact innovations including the Internet of Things, wireless multimedia, artificial intelligence, big data, enterprise platforms, social networks and blockchain. These digital innovations not only bring new opportunities for prosperity and wellbeing but also affect our behaviors, activities, and daily lives. They enable and shape new forms of production and new working practices in sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, logistics and supply chains, energy, and public and business services. Digital innovations are not purely technological but form part of comprehensive systemic innovations of a sociotechnical and networked nature, requiring the alignment of technology, processes, organizations, and humans. Examples are platform-based work, customer driven value creating networks, and urban public service systems. Building on widespread networking, algorithmic decisions and sharing of personal data, these innovations raise intensive societal and ethical debates regarding key issues such as data sovereignty and privacy intrusion, business models based on data surveillance and negative externalization, quality of work and jobs, and market dominance versus regulation. In this context, this book focuses on the implications of digitalization for the domain of work. The book studies the changing nature of work as well as new forms of digitally enabled organizations, work practices and cooperation. The book sheds light on the technological, economic, and political forces shaping the new world of work and on the prospects for human-centric and responsible innovations. To this end, the book brings together a number of studies in five major topics: 1. The evolution of digital technology impacting ways of working; 2. The role of artificial intelligence in new ways of working; 3. Transformation of work, jobs and employment; 4. Digitalization and need for skills and competencies; and 5. New forms of decentralized working and cooperation.",Digital Innovation and the Future of Work,2020-11-30,
How important is income in explaining individuals having forgone healthcare due to cost-sharing payments? Results from a mixed methods sequential explanatory study,"Background: Patients having forgone healthcare because of the costs involved has become more prevalent in recent years. Certain patient characteristics, such as income, are known to be associated with a stronger demand-response to cost-sharing. In this study, we first assess the relative importance of patient characteristics with regard to having forgone healthcare due to cost-sharing payments, and then employ qualitative methods in order to understand these findings better. Methods: Survey data was collected from a Dutch panel of regular users of healthcare. Logistic regression models and dominance analyses were performed to assess the relative importance of patient characteristics, i.e., personal characteristics, health, educational level, sense of mastery and financial situation. Semi-structured interviews (n = 5) were conducted with those who had forgone healthcare. The verbatim transcribed interviews were thematically analyzed. Results: Of the 7,339 respondents who completed the questionnaire, 1,048 respondents (14.3%) had forgone healthcare because of the deductible requirement. The regression model indicated that having a higher income reduced the odds of having forgone recommended healthcare due to the deductible (odds ratios of higher income categories relative to the lowest income category (reference): 0.29–0.49). However, dominance analyses revealed that financial leeway was more important than income: financial leeway contributed the most (34.8%) to the model’s overall McFadden’s pseudo-R2 (i.e., 0.123), followed by income (25.6%). Similar results were observed in stratified models and in population weighted models. Qualitative analyses distinguished four main themes that affected the patient’s decision whether to use healthcare: financial barriers, structural barriers related to the complex design of cost-sharing programs, individual considerations of the patient, and the perceived lack of control regarding treatment choices within a given treatment trajectory. Furthermore, “having forgone healthcare” seemed to have a negative connotation. Conclusion: Our findings show that financial leeway is more important than income with respect to having forgone recommended healthcare due to cost-sharing payments, and that other factors such as the perceived necessity of healthcare also matter. Our findings imply that solely adapting cost-sharing programs to income levels will only get one so far. Our study underlines the need for a broader perspective in the design of cost-sharing programs.",BMC Health Services Research,2022-12-01,10.1186/s12913-022-07527-z
Sustainable supply chain management practices and sustainable performance in hospitals: A systematic review and integrative framework,"Hospital supply chains are responsible for several economic inefficiencies, negative environmental impacts, and social concerns. However, a lack of research on sustainable supply chain management specific to this sector is identified. Existing studies do not analyze supply chain management practices in an integrated and detailed manner, and do not consider all sustainable performance dimensions. To address these gaps, this paper presents a systematic literature review and develops a framework for identifying the supply chain management practices that may contribute to sustainable performance in hospitals. The proposed framework is composed of 12 categories of management practices, which include strategic management and leadership, supplier management, purchasing, warehousing and inventory, transportation and distribution, information and technology, energy, water, food, hospital design, waste, and customer relationship management. On the other side, performance categories include economic, environmental, and social factors. Moreover, illustrative effects of practices on performance are discussed. The novelty of this document lies in its focus on hospital settings, as well as on its comprehensiveness regarding the operationalization of practices and performance dimensions. In addition, a future research agenda is provided, which emphasizes the need for improved research generalizability, empirical validation, integrative addressing, and deeper analysis of relationships between practices and performance.",Sustainability (Switzerland),2019-11-01,10.3390/su11215949

Intellectual property issues in artificial intelligence: Specific reference to the service sector,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed almost every field of the service sector, such as finance, healthcare logistics, automotive and aviation. The innovative technologies can identify uneven patterns like spam filtering or payment deceit, and make aware businesses in actual time about questionable activities, hence are helpful in the growth of a market. These innovation and creation are protected under different forms of intellectual property (IP). However, the transformation from AI related inventions to AI lead inventions has raised substantial challenges to the existing IP infrastructure. This study aims at looking into different aspects of AI related IP protection with an elaborative analysis of the patenting trends through landscape analysis of AI in the service sector. It is observed that AI is playing a pivotal role in the transformation of the service sector due to its accelerating use. But the issues related to legal and ethical need to be addressed for effective utilisation of AI related invention and creation in the service sector.","International Journal of Technological Learning, Innovation and Development",2021-01-01,10.1504/IJTLID.2021.114920
Request and Donation Efficiencies in a Crisis: Data Envelopment Analyses of a Philippine Web-Based Emergency Response System,"On March 16, 2020, the island of Luzon was placed under lockdown to curtail the spread of COVID-19 in the Philippines. Soon thereafter, a web-based emergency response platform was developed to counteract effects from the outbreak. As a free service to strengthen a debilitated national hospital supply chain, the platform connected community organizations (as hospitals) with donors (individuals). From concepts and techniques that addressed information flows in healthcare logistics and supply chain management, several input-oriented data envelopment analyses were conducted to find the efficiencies for each of the 75 hospitals serviced by the website in terms of donors, individual items requested, total quantity of items requested, number of requested individual items that received a pledged, and average days a request pended to fulfillment. Results from the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique found that hospitals on the platform made requests that exceeded optimal quantities of inputs from donors. Further, hospital requests aggregated at the city-level stood unanswered an average of 14.39 days for inefficiently served cities. Findings from the analyses produced three recommendations to improve the web-based emergency response system service efficiency. The first recommendation was to reallocate donors over more hospitals, such that a few hospitals did not receive a majority of donations. A second recommendation was to reduce the number of individually requested items. The third recommendation was to reduce the quantities of items requested in order to bring service efficiency to optimality.",Contributions to Economics,2022-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-89996-7_20
Performance indicator selection for operating room supply chains: An application of ANP,"Manufacturing and maintenance processes significantly benefit from effective and integrated Supply Chain Management (SCM). Recently, hospitals start to recognize the importance of these logistics initiatives to improve their operational performance while also maintaining high quality of patient care. Patient care processes are supported by a range of supply chain activities including inventory management and distribution of medical supplies to point-of-care locations. At the operating room for instance, the logistics staff's goal is managing materials and information flows to have the requested materials at the right operating room at the right time, in the most efficient way. However, poor inventory management, lack of standardization and lack of coordination between departments complicate healthcare logistics processes, and hence result in many waste. Opportunities for efficiency gains in these logistics processes can be identified by measuring the performance of the internal supply chain. This paper presents a rigorously defined logistics performance measurement framework to evaluate the efficiency of logistics processes in operating rooms. The Analytic Network Process (ANP) is utilized as a popular Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique to provide effective decision-support models. The proposed ANP-based framework is a first step towards measuring the performance of operating room supply chain processes by selecting and prioritizing logistics objectives and associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Further research is required to validate the ANP framework by including multiple stakeholders’ preferences, as they may have conflicting views on performance definitions. The final goal of the framework is to support hospital logistics managers in making transparent and informed decisions to improve inventory and distribution policies in the operating room while considering all stakeholders’ preferences.",Operations Research for Health Care,2019-12-01,10.1016/j.orhc.2019.100229
Iterative matheuristic for the biomedical sample transportation problem,"This paper proposes an iterative matheuristic for solving the biomedical sample transportation problem (BSTP), which is a routing problem with multiple and interdependent visits in the context of healthcare services. In this problem, the biomedical samples are collected from individuals at a set of healthcare or specimen collection centers and must be transported to designated laboratories to be analyzed. The perishable nature of the specimens forces to visit the collection centers more than once a day to ensure that the time from the moment they are drawn to the arrival at the laboratory do not exceed the samples lifespan. Also, a visit to one center imposes (1) a limit on the duration of the route that transports its samples to the laboratory, and (2) a limit on the latest time at which the same center must be visited again, creating an interdependency between visits, routes and the decision concerning the centers’ opening times. This paper first proposes a mathematical formulation to model the BSTP. Since this formulation is not able to solve medium or large sized instances efficiently, it also proposes an iterative matheuristic, which includes two main steps. The first step produces an approximated solution to the BSTP by a decomposition approach that splits the problem into a series of smaller subproblems that are solved by the proposed mathematical formulation. In the second step, two fix-&-optimize strategies are used with the mathematical formulation to perform a local search around the solutions produced by the decomposition method. The matheuristic has demonstrated its efficiency solving a rich set of real-life instances corresponding to the needs of several regions in the province of Quebec, Canada, in a fraction of the time required to solve the exact mathematical formulation.",Computers and Industrial Engineering,2024-06-01,10.1016/j.cie.2024.110196
The impact of the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Australian trans community,"Background: Trans and gender diverse individuals (people who identify with a gender different to what was presumed for them at birth) are one of the most medically and socially marginalized groups in our community. The COVID-19 pandemic may compound preexisting depression and thoughts of self-harm or suicide. Aim: We aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Australian trans community. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted between 1st May 2020 and 30th June 2020, amidst strict Australia-wide social restrictions. Australian trans people aged ≥16 years were eligible to participate. Survey questions explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on living situation, employment, financial situation, and healthcare. Logistic regression to assess negative impacts due to COVID-19 on depression and thoughts of self-harm or suicide (measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) are presented as odds ratios (95% confidence interval)). Results: Of 1019 participants, 49.6% reported experiencing financial strain, 22% had reduced working hours, and 22.4% were unemployed (three times the national rate). Concerningly, 61.1% experienced clinically significant symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≥10), considerably higher than pre-COVID rates for the trans community and over twice the national rate. Moreover, 49% reported thoughts of self-harm or suicide (over three times the national rate) which was more likely if a person experienced cancelation or postponement of gender-affirming surgery (OR 1.56 (1.04, 2.35)), financial strain (OR 1.80 (1.36, 2.38)), or felt unsafe or afraid in their household (OR 1.96 (1.23, 3.08)). Discussion: Given rates of clinically significant depression and thoughts of self-harm or suicide are far higher in trans people than the general population, specific strategies to improve mental health in the trans community during the COVID-19 pandemic must be made a priority for policymakers, researchers, and health service providers to prevent suicide.

Enhancing COVID-19 vaccination and medication distribution routing strategies in rural regions of Morocco: A comparative metaheuristics analysis,"The optimization of the vaccination campaign and medication distribution in rural regions of Morocco conducted by the Ministry of Health can be significantly improved by employing metaheuristic algorithms in conjunction with a tour planning system. This research proposes the utilization of six metaheuristic algorithms: genetic algorithm, rat swarm optimization, whale optimization, spotted hyena optimizer, penguins search optimization, and particle swarm optimization, to determine the most efficient routes for equipped trucks carrying vaccines and medications. These algorithms consider critical field constraints, such as operating hours of vaccination centers, vaccine availability, and distances between centers while minimizing the overall journey duration. In addition, a comprehensive tour planning system is integrated into the optimization framework accounting for transportation costs such as fuel expenses and truck maintenance costs. By incorporating these factors, the Ministry of Health aims to achieve the maximum efficiency while minimizing the financial burden associated with the vaccination campaign in rural areas. The integration of metaheuristics and the tour planning system presents a robust and data-driven solution for the Ministry of Health to enhance the effectiveness of their vaccination and medication distribution campaigns in rural regions of Morocco. This approach not only minimizes costs but also improves overall efficiency by ensuring timely access to vaccines and medications for the rural population. The findings of this research contribute to the growing body of knowledge in the field of healthcare logistics optimization and provide valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners involved in similar campaigns worldwide.",Informatics in Medicine Unlocked,2024-01-01,10.1016/j.imu.2024.101467

DEEP LEARNING FOR THE PREDICTION OF TRANS-BORDER LOGISTICS OF PATIENTS TO MEDICAL CENTERS,"Background: Covid 19 impacted many healthcare logistics systems. An enormous number of people suffer from the effect of a pandemic, infection diseases can spread rapidly within and between countries. People from the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Lao People's Democratic Republic are most likely to cross-border into Thailand for diagnosis and special treatment. In this situation, international referral cannot predict the volume of patients and their destination. Therefore, the aim of the research is to use deep learning to construct a model that predicts the travel demand of patients at the border. Methods: Based on previous emergency medical services, the prediction demand used the gravity model or the regression model. The novelty element in this research paper uses the neural network technique. In this study, a two-stage survey is used to collect data. The first phase interviews experts from the strategic group level of The Public Health Office. The second phase examines the patient?s behavior regarding route selection using a survey. The methodology uses deep learning training using the Sigmoid function and Identity function. The statistics of precision include the average percent relative error (APRE), the root mean square error (RMSE), the standard deviation (SD), and the correlation coefficient (R). Results: Deep learning is suitable for complex problems as a network. The model allows the different data sets to forecast the demand for the cross-border patient for each hospital. Equations are applied to forecast demand, in which the different hospitals require a total of 58,000 patients per year to be diagnosed by the different hospitals. The predictor performs better than the RBF and regression model. Conclusions: The novelty element of this research uses the deep learning technique as an efficient nonlinear model; moreover, it is suitable for dynamic prediction. The main advantage is to apply this model to predict the number of patients, which is the key to determining the supply chain of treatment; additionally, the ability to formulate guidelines with healthcare logistics effectively in the future.",Logforum,2022-01-01,10.17270/J.LOG.2022.689
Insights before flights: How community perceptions can make or break medical drone deliveries,"Drones are increasingly used to transport health products, but life-saving interventions can be stalled if local community concerns and preferences are not assessed and addressed. In order to inform the introduction of drones in new contexts, this paper analyzed similarities and differences in community perceptions of medical delivery drones in Malawi, Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Dominican Republic (DR). Community perceptions were assessed using focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) conducted with stakeholders at the national level, at health facilities and in communities. Data were collected on respondents’ familiarity with drones, perceptions of benefits and risks of drones, advice on drone operations and recommendations on sharing information with the community. The comparative analysis found similar perceptions around the potential benefits of using drones, as well as important differences in the perceived risks of flying drones and culturally appropriate communication mechanisms based on the local context. Because community perceptions are heavily influenced by culture and local experiences, a similar assessment should be conducted before introducing drone activities in new areas and two-way feedback channels should be established once drone operations are established in an area. The extent to which a community understands and supports the use of drones to transport health products will ultimately play a critical role in the success or failure of the drone’s ability to bring life-saving products to those who need them.",Drones,2020-09-01,10.3390/drones4030051
The future of asset management,"Deming was famous for asking people, ""By What Method?"" an objective would be accomplished. Any useful concept has embedded in it the answer to that question. Asset management, to be a valuable concept, must demonstrate a method that leads to success. The method should be inclusive of all the necessary elements, yet be simple to understand. We present a broader view of asset management here, built upon three core operating functions: Lead, Execute and Enable. The execute function is always performed in the plant environment. Manufacturing success is relative to the competition however. Whoever can make the best products at the lowest cost will win. Lead and enable are the great determinants of that relative success. In addition, physical asset management has an identity crisis. Most practitioners use the term synonymously with the maintenance function. Asset Management's opportunity, however, goes beyond maintenance to be a guiding principal for all of manufacturing. This paper explores the four integrated facets of the Execute function in the plant: Capacity acquisition and disposition Production Asset Healthcare Logistics Our model, then, represents the future of asset management, suggesting ""The Method"", necessary elements for successful manufacturing.",TAPPI Fall Technical Conference,2004-12-01,

An Automated Enhancement System of Diabetic Retinopathy Fundus Image for Eye Care Facilities,"Examining retinal fundus images is compulsory for ophthalmologists to spot features of eye diseases. Some problems, including low contrast and blurred retinal fundus image, may seriously affect the diagnostic procedure, leading to misdiagnosis. Low quality of retinal fundus image makes recognition of features for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) to be harder for the ophthalmologist. Moreover, there is a lack of eye care facilities infrastructure with ophthalmologists to serve multi-morbid DR patients in rural areas, specifically Malaysia. Hence, this research proposed the development of an automated enhancement system based on computer vision and the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field to improve the quality of fundus images captured. The DR Enhancement System (DRES) helps ophthalmologists in the screening aspect by improving the detection of aberrant fundus images. Several methods for improving the fundus image are utilized: Retinex, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and Low-light enhancement. Results show that all methods performed better when improving low-contrast and blurred images. This study contributes to the screening process of DR by improving the quality of the retinal fundus image. The developed AI-based system can also help to solve healthcare logistics problems of reaching DR patients in rural areas.",Communications in Computer and Information Science,2024-01-01,10.1007/978-981-99-9592-9_8
Optimized Workflow for the Healthcare Logistic: Case of the Pediatric Emergency Department,"The Emergency Department (ED) in a hospital, as its name implies, is a facility to be utilized by those who require emergency medical care. This paper introduces the longitudinal organization of the patient handling"" in the Pediatric Emergency called the ""Pediatric Emergency Path"". This work discusses the usability of the workflow approach in order to design the patient path in the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) in order to thwart the care complexity scheme. The goal is to optimize these paths to improve the quality of the patient handling while mastering the wait time. The development of this model was based on accurate visits made in the PED of the Regional University Hospital Center (CHRU) of Lille (France). This modeling, which has to represent most faithfully possible the reality of the PED of CHRU of Lille, is necessary.

A Roadmap Towards Healthcare Logistics in Thailand,"Apart from operation dimension in supply chain, another perspective in healthcare supply chain is the infrastructure for Logistics. This infrastructure concerns much in data and information flows. The study focuses on three levels for constructing this infrastructures: Public health policy maker, provincial public health office and hospital levels. A survey was conducted. The framework for data collections was based on data standardization, database and its applications. The findings identified the status of such areas. It shows that lack of standardization could lead to poor information in the supply chain. Five core components for the foundation are recommended. These are standard data, standard exchange data, a single data pool, ability to track and trace and data centre. Implications and suggestions for policy makers are recommended.","2017 International Conference on Industrial Engineering, Management Science and Application, ICIMSA 2017",2017-07-19,10.1109/ICIMSA.2017.7985578
Real-time management of intra-hospital patient transport requests,"This paper addresses the management of patients’ transportation requests within a hospital, a very challenging problem where requests must be scheduled among the available porters so that patients arrive at their destination timely and the resources invested in patient transport are kept as low as possible. Transportation requests arrive during the day in an unpredictable manner, so they need to be scheduled in real-time. To ensure that the requests are scheduled in the best possible manner, one should also reconsider the decisions made on pending requests that have not yet been completed, a process that will be referred to as rescheduling. This paper proposes several policies to trigger and execute the rescheduling of pending requests and three approaches (a mathematical formulation, a constructive heuristic, and a local search heuristic) to solve each rescheduling problem. A simulation tool is proposed to assess the performance of the rescheduling strategies and the proposed scheduling methods to tackle instances inspired by a real mid-size hospital. Compared to a heuristic that mimics the way requests are currently handled in our partner hospital, the best combination of scheduling method and rescheduling strategy produces an average 5.7 minutes reduction in response time and a 13% reduction in the percentage of late requests. Furthermore, since the total distance walked by porters is substantially reduced, our experiments demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the number of porters – and therefore the operating costs – without reducing the current level of service.",Health Care Management Science,2024-01-01,10.1007/s10729-024-09667-6
