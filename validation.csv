Towards an it-based coordination platform for the german emergency medical service system,"The German healthcare service system is facing a number of challenges in the years to come, prominent among these a decreasing number of hospitals and practices dealing with an increasing number of treatments and patient transportation tasks. In this paper, we introduce the idea of building a decision support tool to improve scheduling of patient transportation in the German Emergency Medical Service (EMS) system to reduce waiting times and costs, as well as increasing reliability. We outline a service platform on which the decision support tool could be realized and integrated with existing systems in EMS coordination centers. The paper thus introduces a promising approach for one of the main challenges of the German EMS system and builds the basis for further research on transport scheduling and healthcare services.",Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-14980-6_20
Measuring process performance within healthcare logistics - a decision tool for selecting track and trace technologies,"Monitoring tasks and ascertaining quality of work is difficult in a logistical healthcare process due to cleaning personnel being dispersed throughout the hospital. Performance measurement can support the organization in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of processes and in ensuring quality of work. Data validity is essential for enabling performance measurement, and selecting the right technologies is important to achieve this. A case study of the hospital cleaning process was conducted at a public Danish hospital to develop a framework for assessing technologies in healthcare logistics. A set of decision indicators was identified in the case study to assess technologies based on expected process performance. Two aspects of performance measurement were investigated for the hospital cleaning process: what to measure and how to measure it.",Academy of Strategic Management Journal,2015-01-01,
An efficient adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm based on heuristics and reformulations for the generalized quadratic assignment problem,"Operations Research (OR) analytics play a crucial role in optimizing decision-making processes for real-world problems. The assignment problem, with applications in supply chains, healthcare logistics, and production scheduling, represents a prominent optimization challenge. This paper focuses on addressing the Generalized Quadratic Assignment Problem (GQAP), a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. To tackle the GQAP, we propose an OR analytical approach that incorporates efficient relaxations, reformulations, heuristics, and a metaheuristic algorithm. Initially, we employ the Reformulation Linearization Technique (RLT) to generate various linear relaxation models, carefully selecting the most efficient ones. Building upon this foundation, we introduce a robust reformulation based on Benders Decomposition (BD), which serves as the basis for an iterative optimization algorithm applied to the GQAP. Furthermore, we develop a constructive heuristic algorithm to identify near-optimal solutions, followed by an enhancement utilizing an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) metaheuristic algorithm. This ALNS algorithm is enhanced through the integration of a tabu list derived from Tabu Search (TS) and a decision rule inspired by Simulated Annealing (SA). To validate our approach and evaluate its performance, we conduct a comparative analysis against state-of-the-art algorithms documented in the literature. This comparison confirms the significant improvements achieved in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency through our proposed methodology. These advancements contribute to the state of the art in solving the GQAP and hold the potential to enhance decision-making processes in a wide range of domains. Our methodology demonstrates remarkable improvements in solution quality and computational efficiency when compared to existing approaches, as evidenced by the comparative results with state-of-the-art algorithms. The potential implications of our research extend to optimizing decision-making processes in diverse fields, rendering it highly relevant and impactful.",Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2023-11-01,10.1016/j.engappai.2023.106802
Technological implementation in the service sector: A case study,"The service industry is a crucial industry recognized as the biggest of the three sectors of the economy. Implementing technology in this industry has been the driving force for industrial advancement. In contrast, this industry's disproportionate adoption of technology explains the disparity between developing and developed worlds. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been recognized as the newest technology disrupting and driving innovation in the service industry, with the quest for superior business experience and customer service driving its adoption. However, AI is not the only technology driving transformations in the service industry but also a constituent of innovative technologies, such as search, chatbots, cloud computing, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), mobile, social, and the IoT. In addition, this chapter advocates for the fourth component of cloud computing to be named diversity as a service (DaaS). Technology is the most significant enabler of globalization. Globalization is the most fantastic driver of diversities-creating opportunities, virtual, and physical, for people from different cultural, religious, racial, geographical, and other backgrounds to interact. However, this confluence of diversities is leading to unsavory human experiences giving rise to racial protests, gender inequalities, underrepresentation of ethnic minorities, and others. However, implementing technology in diversity management could be the elixir to these problems. The chapter seeks to explore the implications of technology implementation in the service industry to ascertain whether the economic impact of technology in the service industry influences its adoption and how to encourage technology adoption in the service industry. The chapter also analyzes whether technology implementation in the service sector is economical to provide organizations with a decision-making tool for further exploring the industry and making experimental projections of technology's prognosis in the service industry to encourage research and scientific activity. This is because many or most of the literature on AI are projections, simulations, and assumptions emphasizing how the implementation of AI will increase unemployment and change the labor landscape in ways that may not be familiar to many. We adapted the core generalizations from some of these reports to evaluate these projections. Academic and research reports from the sciences, engineering, and medicine on information technology (IT) and the U.S. workforce into an analytical framework because it embodies the core assumptions of most of the literature on the subject. We then used the analytical framework to analyze secondary data from those who have implemented these technologies to see whether the implementation of technology in the service sector was economical or not and whether economic factors affected the adoption of the technology. Finally, we explored possible extensions of existing knowledge as experimental projections to encourage further research. Furthermore, the chapter explored three critical sectors of the service industry as case studies, including the Healthcare, Logistics, and Entertainment sectors, and attempted an economic analysis of the implementation of technology in these sectors and projected experimental investigation of the consequences of implementing technology in these sectors in the future. It was noticed that the implementation of technology in the service industry is gaining increased adoption with signs of growing adoption into the future. Economically, the performance of technology increases productivity, lowers costs, and transforms the way work is done and changes the labor landscape, with machines gaining greater involvement and acceptance as co-workers with human counterparts. This shows the economic benefits of implementing technology in the service sector in increasing its adoption. Most importantly, it was established that different levels of education, not technology, are the causes of income inequalities. Generally, the implementation of technology increases the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery in these sectors, leading to labor efficiency, increased productivity, and cost-effectiveness. Experimentally, the chapter projects that we are entering the era of flying cargoes and rocket-like cargo ships. The chapter concludes with claims that though machines will see greater adoption in the entertainment industry, they will not substitute human creativity in serving entertainment, and humans will always cherish entertainment served by humans and treat machine-generated entertainment as fiction.",Artificial Intelligence for Smart Technology in the Hospitality and Tourism Industry,2024-07-05,
An iterated local search for the biomedical sample transportation problem with multiple and interdependent pickups,"This article addresses a new version of the biomedical sample transportation problem, as a vehicle routing problem with precedence constraints arising in the context of healthcare logistics, and proposes an iterated local search algorithm to solve it. This new version is more realistic and complex since it considers the collection centres’ opening hours and the moment at which they are visited as decision variables, granting additional flexibility to elaborate more efficient routes. Indeed, this problem is harder to model and to solve than its previous version because the constraint on the short samples’ lifetime leads to interdependency between successive pickups at each collection center. A metaheuristic is thus proposed to solve real-life instances. Numerical experiments confirm (1) the value of simultaneously planning routes, opening hours, and visit hours (which is new in the literature) and (2) the efficiency of the proposed algorithm to solve this problem.",Journal of the Operational Research Society,2021-01-01,10.1080/01605682.2019.1657369
Study and Analysis of Discrete Event-Driven Autonomous System with a Case Study for a Robotics Task,"Highly probabilistic, potential, and dynamic domains are only relatively known to contribute classical techniques for complex system establishment impossible. Currently available technologies and strategies do not adequately address these novel needs. Thus, by enabling autonomous systems to adapt, decision-making and learning abilities, we can empower them with sufficient and appropriate expertise to recognize and address such issues. To address these requirements, discrete event-driven systems (DEDS) have been developed. This system can help the technologists of future autonomous systems by simulating the effect of auxiliary designs on the performance of the autonomous system. For modeling regular feedback of performance that is influenced by traditional techniques and depends on trust, the discrete event-driven method is most suited. This paper describes the DEDS system, the modeling of this system, and as well as the supervisory control system by explaining the supervisor, and partial supervisor. A comprehensive literature survey has been carried out in this article to explain the controllability, diagnosability, and observability potential of the DEDS system for various applications. Some of the major areas of applications such as healthcare, logistics, robotics, and banking sectors, have been discussed. Also, we have explained this system with the help of modeling a discrete event system for a queuing problem associated with robotics tasks as an example by the simulation with MATLAB 2022a. Lastly, the possible future research directions in the DEDS advancement have been provided.",Przeglad Elektrotechniczny,2023-01-01,10.15199/48.2023.09.09
Optimising the booking horizon in healthcare clinics considering no-shows and cancellations,"Patient no-shows and cancellations are a significant problem to healthcare clinics, as they compromise a clinic's efficiency. Therefore, it is important to account for both no-shows and cancellations into the design of appointment systems. To provide additional empirical evidence on no-show and cancellation behaviour, we assess outpatient clinic data from two healthcare providers in the USA and EU: no-show and cancellation rates increase with the scheduling interval, which is the number of days from the appointment creation to the date the appointment is scheduled for. We show the temporal cancellation behaviour for multiple scheduling intervals is bimodally distributed. To improve the efficiency of clinics at a tactical level of control, we determine the optimal booking horizon such that the impact of no-shows and cancellations through high scheduling intervals is minimised, against a cost of rejecting patients. Where the majority of the literature only includes a fixed no-show rate, we include both a cancellation rate and a time-dependent no-show rate. We propose an analytical queuing model with balking and reneging, to determine the optimal booking horizon. Simulation experiments show that the assumptions of this model are viable. Computational results demonstrate general applicability of our model by case studies of two hospitals.",International Journal of Production Research,2022-01-01,10.1080/00207543.2021.1913292
Non-medical barriers in access to early steps of kidney transplantation in the United States – A scoping review,"Background: In the United States (US), barriers in access to later steps in the kidney transplantation process (i.e. waitlisting) have been well documented. Barriers in access to earlier steps (i.e. referral and evaluation) are less well described due to the lack of national surveillance data. In this review, we summarize the available literature on non-medical barriers in access to kidney transplant referral and evaluation. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a scoping review of the literature through June 3, 2021. We included all studies (quantitative and qualitative) reporting on barriers to kidney transplant referral and evaluation in the US published from 1990 onwards in English and among adult end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42014015027). We narratively synthesized results across studies. Results: We retrieved information from 33 studies published from 1990 to 2021 (reporting data between 1990 and 2018). Most studies (n = 28, 85%) described barriers among patient populations, three (9%) among provider populations, and two (6%) included both patients and providers. Key barriers were identified across multiple levels and included patient- (e.g. demographic, socioeconomic, sociocultural, and knowledge), provider- (e.g. miscommunication, staff availability, provider perceptions and attitudes), and system- (e.g. geography, distance to care, healthcare logistics) level factors. Conclusions: A multi-pronged approach (e.g. targeted and systemwide interventions, and policy change) implemented at multiple levels of the healthcare system will be necessary to reduce identified barriers in access to early kidney transplant steps. Collection of national surveillance data on these early kidney transplant steps is also needed to enhance our understanding of barriers to referral and evaluation.",Transplantation Reviews,2021-12-01,10.1016/j.trre.2021.100654
Cognizant healthcare logistics management: Ensuring resilience during crisis,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to convey a message of preparedness and mitigation to key stakeholders throughout the healthcare community concerning healthcare supply chain readiness and preparedness. Design/methodology/approach: Using a review of existent literature, this work examines and expounds upon the impact of effective supply chain management processes in disaster mitigation and planning. Findings: This paper presents a discourse in supply chain managers' involvement in disaster planning, identifying courses of action, and collaboratively planning for crisis. Logistics is a specific genre of skill sets within healthcare operations. Practical implications: Key tenets of logistics readiness and preparedness are often missed when developing strategies for disaster mitigation. While this discussion is directed specifically toward healthcare management, the principles are applicable across a wide array of industries. Social implications: Disaster affects everyone and is likely to occur in any type of organization. Leaders have an inherent responsibility to plan for both expected and unexpected events; the latter can present complexities that require intuitive reaction provided scenarios have been considered in advance. Arguably, the critical path to success involves effective process management and collaborative communications across multiple echelons of managerial responsibilities. Originality/value: Few works were found concerning healthcare supply chain management involvement in disaster readiness. In an applied sense, this paper provides healthcare managers with concepts related to effective crisis mitigation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",International Journal of Disaster Resilience in the Built Environment,2011-10-01,10.1108/17595901111167114
ONLINE CAPACITY PLANNING for REHABILITATION TREATMENTS: AN APPROXIMATE DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING APPROACH,"We study an online capacity planning problem in which arriving patients require a series of appointments at several departments, within a certain access time target. This research is motivated by a study of rehabilitation planning practices at the Sint Maartenskliniek hospital (the Netherlands). In practice, the prescribed treatments and activities are typically booked starting in the first available week, leaving no space for urgent patients who require a series of appointments at a short notice. This leads to the rescheduling of appointments or long access times for urgent patients, which has a negative effect on the quality of care and on patient satisfaction. We propose an approach for allocating capacity to patients at the moment of their arrival, in such a way that the total number of requests booked within their corresponding access time targets is maximized. The model considers online decision making regarding multi-priority, multi-appointment, and multi-resource capacity allocation. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that takes into account the current patient schedule, and future arrivals. We develop an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to obtain approximate optimal capacity allocation policies. We provide insights into the characteristics of the optimal policies and evaluate the performance of the resulting policies using simulation.",Probability in the Engineering and Informational Sciences,2020-07-01,10.1017/S0269964818000402
Optimized Workflow for the Healthcare Logistic: Case of the Pediatric Emergency Department,"The Emergency Department (ED) in a hospital, as its name implies, is a facility to be utilized by those who require emergency medical care. This paper introduces the longitudinal organization of the patient handling"" in the Pediatric Emergency called the ""Pediatric Emergency Path"". This work discusses the usability of the workflow approach in order to design the patient path in the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) in order to thwart the care complexity scheme. The goal is to optimize these paths to improve the quality of the patient handling while mastering the wait time. The development of this model was based on accurate visits made in the PED of the Regional University Hospital Center (CHRU) of Lille (France). This modeling, which has to represent most faithfully possible the reality of the PED of CHRU of Lille, is necessary. It must be enough retailed to produce an analysis allowing to identify the dysfunctions of the PED and also to propose and to estimate prevention indicators of tensions.

Capacity planning in healthcare: Finding solutions for healthy planning in nursing home care,"Matching supply and demand in nursing home practice is not straightforward, as it always takes place within a 'client-care worker-organizational' triangle. This chapter illustrates how data-driven capacity planning can support nursing homes in their search for ways to further increase their efficiency while maintaining an appropriate quality level of care. This is done using a framework based on a four-step approach adopted from workforce management in call centres. In addition, it is also shown that data-driven capacity planning allows for a more evenly spread workload for the care workers.","Integrating the Organization of Health Services, Worker Wellbeing and Quality of Care: Towards Healthy Healthcare",2021-01-25,10.1007/978-3-030-59467-1_8
Energy efficient approach to send data in cognitive radio wireless sensor networks(CRSN),"The adoption of cognitive radio wireless sensor networks be supposed to preserve developing, essentially in such a fields as a healthcare, logistic, scientific and a military applications. Yet, a sensor size or dimension represents a consequential constraint mainly in expressions of an energy autonomy and as a result of a life period for the batteries which is so too tiny. Thus, the reason why a concentrated research being conducted at the present time on how to control energy consumption in sensor within a network, taking communications into account as a precedence. For this intention, we propose a algorithm or method to send data from source to sink with a less energy consumption within cognitive wireless sensor networks, according to the number of nodes, data flow rate, and the distance between them. Moreover, we have succeeded in sinking energy utilization within a linear sensor network through up with nodes featuring with differing data flow rates between them.","2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics, ICACCI 2016",2016-11-02,10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732352
Evaluation and Visualization of Blockchain-Based Healthcare,"Blockchain is a distributed ledger apparatus that utilizes timestamped blocks to manage and verify various transactions between two parties in a network with the help of cryptographic algorithms. As compared to popular opinion, blockchain not only serves as a backbone to cryptocurrencies but it can also serve as a pioneering solution to various disciplinary fields such as healthcare, logistics, and education. The approach taken by this chapter to tackle the various problems faced by the healthcare sector utilizes blockchain technology. It avails smart contracts as well as the decentralized nature of the blockchain and smart tokens to ensure smooth interactions between the patients and the physicians. Protection and maintaining the integrity of healthcare data without overlooking any security threats are the primary objectives of this chapter.

Logistical and structural challenges are the major obstacles for family medicine physicians’ ability to administer adult vaccines,"Purpose: This study was conducted to characterize the vaccination practices and challenges of family medicine physicians in Los Angeles County, California. Methods: The Los Angeles Academy of Family Physicians (LA AFP) sent out electronic surveys to all of their active members (N = 1121) between December 2017 and January 2018, and asked them to answer questions about themselves, their practice, their patient population, and their immunization practices and challenges. We then analyzed the results through basic statistical calculations and Pearson’s chi-squared tests. Results: Seventy-four people (6.6%) responded to the survey, and 75% of responders stated that they administer all Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended vaccines. The lowest vaccine administration rates were for the high-dose influenza vaccine, which 66.2% (n = 49) of respondents reported to administer, followed by the meningococcal B vaccine (68.9%; n = 51). The respondents who belonged to practices with more than 11 providers, were part of a large hospital or healthcare system, had electronic medical records (EMRs), and used the California Immunization Registry (CAIR) were more likely to report to vaccinate. The number one responding physician-reported challenge to vaccination was limited time and resources to address patient resistance followed by vaccine cost and lack of infrastructure to store vaccines. Conclusions: In this pilot study, structural and logistical challenges appeared to make the biggest impact on adult vaccination for the responding family medicine physicians. Solutions addressing these challenges will help improve the adult immunization rates.",Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics,2019-03-04,10.1080/21645515.2018.1543524

Enhancing healthcare supply chain management through artificial intelligence-driven group decision-making with Sugeno–Weber triangular norms in a dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy context,"The healthcare industry faces numerous challenges in managing its supply chain efficiently, where critical decisions must be made promptly to ensure the availability of essential medical resources. This research introduces a novel artificial intelligence (AI) approach, utilizing the “Sugeno–Weber (SW) t-conorms and t-norms” (SWt-CNs&t-Ns) for decision-making in a Dual Hesitant q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy (DHq-ROF) context. The SWt-CNs&t-Ns are chosen for their adaptability in data unification, serving as prominent operations for union and intersection processes. Developing a set of fundamental operations is imperative to effectively utilize SWt-CNs&t-Ns and hybrid aggregation operators in DHq-ROF settings. Following the introduction of these processes, several aggregating operators have been provided. These operators include DHq-ROF SW weighted averaging, ordered weighted averaging, hybrid averaging, and their geometric counterparts utilizing DHq-ROF data. The SW triangular norm-based approach aggregates group preferences, facilitating a systematic decision-making process. Triangular norms ensure a realistic representation of interrelationships among decision criteria, leading to optimal healthcare supply chain management solutions. Furthermore, the SW triangular norm-based approach aggregates group preferences, enabling a systematic and comprehensive decision-making process. Choosing the best healthcare supply chain management solutions is easier when you use triangular norms because they give a more accurate picture of how the decision criteria affect each other. The effectiveness of the proposed AI framework is demonstrated through a series of experiments and case studies, showcasing its ability to enhance decision accuracy, reduce uncertainty, and improve overall supply chain performance. The research findings underscore the potential of AI-driven solutions to revolutionize healthcare supply chain management, ultimately leading to better resource allocation, cost efficiency, and improved patient care.",Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2024-09-01,10.1016/j.engappai.2024.108794

Progress towards data standards adoption in healthcare,"The contribution of this paper is to report on the progress of and barriers to adoption of data standards in healthcare logistics. This paper is directed to engineering managers with an interest in healthcare management, information management, and supply chain management. Data standards in healthcare logistics fall into two categories: product identification numbers and location identification numbers. Product identification numbers are assigned to any item that may be priced, ordered, or invoiced at any point in any supply chain, location identification numbers are used to identify physical locations to improve the efficiency of communication with the supply chain. The main objective of this paper is to convey the potential benefits of data standards adoption in the healthcare supply chain and present empirical evidence of progress toward adoption as well as a discussion of barriers toward adoption. Data is presented and analyzed from surveys conducted in 2008, 2010 and 2011. The results show encouraging progress being made towards data standards adoption; however, many barriers still exist. Engineering managers will appreciate the potential benefits of data standards adoption in healthcare logistics and will see the role engineers and engineering managers can have in facilitating data standards adoption and overcoming the barriers faced. Engineering managers will also see the opportunities for healthcare process improvement once data standards are adopted.

A case study: Application of network clock model to heterogeneous sensor networks,"A sensor network consists of sensor nodes that have sensing, computation and wireless communication capabilities. There are various sensor network applications, including disaster relief operations, environmental monitoring and control, precision agriculture, intelligent home and buildings, facility management, machine surveillance and preventive maintenance, medicine and healthcare, logistics, telematics, and others. Many of these applications share some basic functionalities, namely event detection, periodic measurement and tracking, all of which entail collecting and forwarding of event data. For the purposes of triggering an action, it is necessary to know when an event occurs. Certainly time is an essential factor in many sensor network applications. This paper proposes, based on a cast study, a network clock model application to heterogeneous sensor networks. The network clock model is a scheme by which a consistent notion of time can be shared among sensor networks’ devices in order to enable the combination of time and data for applications. This work serves to demonstrate the acquisition, keeping and distribution of standard time in a heterogeneous sensor network platform based on the network clock model.",Journal of Communications,2019-07-01,10.12720/jcm.14.7.587-592
Implementation of a new echocardiographic practice during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Due to the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, healthcare logistics have changed abruptly and significantly in all medical specialties, of which cardiovascular services are no exception.
