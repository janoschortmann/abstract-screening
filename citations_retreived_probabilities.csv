Association of open communication and the emotional and behavioural impact of medical error on patients and families: state-wide cross-sectional survey,"Background How openly healthcare providers communicate after a medical error may influence long-term impacts. We sought to understand whether greater open communication is associated with fewer persisting emotional impacts, healthcare avoidance and loss of trust. Methods Cross-sectional 2018 recontact survey assessing experience with medical error in a 2017 random digit dial survey of Massachusetts residents. Two hundred and fifty-three respondents self-reported medical error. Respondents were similar to non-respondents in sociodemographics confirming minimal response bias. Time since error was categorised as <1, 1–2 or 3–6 years before interview. Open communication was measured with six questions assessing different communication elements. Persistent impacts included emotional (eg, sadness, anger), healthcare avoidance (specific providers or all medical care) and loss of trust in healthcare. Logistic regressions examined the association between open communication and long-term impacts. Results Of respondents self-reporting a medical error 3–6 years ago, 51% reported at least one current emotional impact; 57% reported avoiding doctor/facilities involved in error; 67% reported loss of trust. Open communication varied: 34% reported no communication and 24% reported ≥5 elements. Controlling for error severity, respondents reporting the most open communication had significantly lower odds of persisting sadness (OR=0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.60, p=0.006), depression (OR=0.16, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.77, p=0.022) or feeling abandoned/betrayed (OR=0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.48, p=0.004) compared with respondents reporting no communication. Open communication significantly predicted less doctor/facility avoidance, but was not associated with medical care avoidance or healthcare trust. Conclusions Negative emotional impacts from medical error can persist for years. Open communication is associated with reduced emotional impacts and decreased avoidance of doctors/facilities involved in the error. Communication and resolution programmes could facilitate transparent conversations and reduce some of the negative impacts of medical error.",BMJ Quality and Safety,2020-01-20,10.1136/bmjqs-2019-010367,0.9904606734630287
An evaluation of the delivery of medicines using drones,"This study tests the impact of drone transportation on the quality of a medicine. Modelling the critical process parameters of drone flight, the effects of temperature and vibration on insulin were investigated using the pharmacopoeia methods. The medicine, Actrapid, (3.5 mg/mL of insulin), was flown by a quad-rotor drone. Insulin stored between −20 and 40◦C for 30 mins, and subjected to vibration (0–40 Hz, 25◦C, 30 mins) passed the pharmacopeia tests. Dynamic light scattering identified the active tetrameric and hexameric forms of insulin post testing. Vibration frequencies during drone flight were between 0.1 and 3.4 Hz. There was no evidence of visible insulin aggregates following the drone transportation. The differences in UV absorbance readings between flown Actrapid and controls were insignificant (p = 0.89). No adverse impact of drone transport on insulin was observed. This study provides supporting evidence that drone transportation of medicinal products containing insulin is feasible. The authors recommend that when considering the drone delivery of medicines five tests need to be applied. These tests must determine the safe flight time and range, the quality of the medicine post flight, the onboard conditions experienced by the medicine, the security of the drone supply chain and the effect of drone failure on both the medicine and the environment.",Drones,2019-09-01,10.3390/drones3030052,0.9818631226067107
Influenza vaccine uptake among older adults in Brazil: Socioeconomic equality and the role of preventive policies and public services,"Background: Influenza is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Since 1999, influenza vaccine is provided free-of-charge to adults aged 60 years or more in Brazil. Although vaccination coverage is high, previous studies have shown that socioeconomic and lifestyle factors play an essential role in predicting vaccine uptake. This study aimed to investigate whether previous knowledge of factors that constrain influenza vaccine uptake among older adults contributed to increasing the access to vaccination in 2015–16. Methods: This cross-sectional study assessed data from the baseline of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging. This national representative sample encompassed individuals aged 60 and older (n = 5221). Vaccination status was the outcome variable; covariates included socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics, health status, and access to healthcare. Logistic regression fitted the association between vaccine uptake and covariates. Results: The coverage of influenza vaccination was 73.0% (95% confidence interval: 70.6–75.2); ranking lower than the goal of 80% set up by the national health authority. The most frequent reasons to justify the option of skipping vaccination were cultural beliefs about the lack of efficacy and possible side effects of the vaccine. The coverage of vaccination did not differ by socioeconomic characteristics. Older individuals, never smokers, having two or more chronic diseases, and being registered in the Family Health Program were positively associated with influenza vaccine uptake. Conclusions: Absent socioeconomic inequalities point out changes in the barriers to vaccination. These findings provide insights into tailoring public health strategies, targeting professional recommendations and public perceptions of the vaccine.",Journal of Infection and Public Health,2020-02-01,10.1016/j.jiph.2019.07.022,0.9758719391565625
"Healthcare commodities for emergencies in Africa: review of logistics models, suggested model and research agenda","Purpose: Enormous numbers of people suffer from the effects of disasters and humanitarian crises in Africa, including medical and healthcare emergencies. International response to the 2014–2016 Ebola pandemic in West Africa and COVID 19 pandemic vividly demonstrates the need for efficient and effective logistics and supply chain systems in bringing succor to impacted and vulnerable communities. This paper critically reviews the academic literature on logistics models for sourcing, delivery and distribution of medical and healthcare products for humanitarian emergencies in Africa from 1990 to 2018. The paper suggests areas for further research and proposes an effective logistics model useful for international and national humanitarian organizations as well as public health authorities in Africa and developing areas. Design/methodology/approach: The viewpoint paper draws upon a structured comprehensive and critical review of the academic literature on logistics and supply chain management and a qualitative analysis of the literature in 13 leading academic databases covering over 5,550 articles. Findings: The paper finds significant gaps in the body of logistics and supply chain management research on practical deployable logistics models for sourcing, delivery, and distribution of medical and healthcare products for humanitarian emergencies. The paper suggests a model worthy of consideration by humanitarian and disaster response stakeholders as well as public health authorities in developing countries. Research limitations/implications: This is a critical literature review paper based on a comprehensive literature research and analysis for the period from 1990 to 2018 from which a viewpoint is formed. Social implications: This paper advocates for further research on appropriate models of logistics for the sourcing, delivery and distribution of medical and healthcare products to enhance the basic human rights and dignity of vulnerable people in developing countries. Originality/value: The paper contributes directly to policy on logistics, humanitarian aid, disaster management, public health and health security policy in the developing world including Africa.",Journal of Humanitarian Logistics and Supply Chain Management,2020-08-17,10.1108/JHLSCM-09-2019-0064,0.9709843345615232
How important is income in explaining individuals having forgone healthcare due to cost-sharing payments? Results from a mixed methods sequential explanatory study,"Background: Patients having forgone healthcare because of the costs involved has become more prevalent in recent years. Certain patient characteristics, such as income, are known to be associated with a stronger demand-response to cost-sharing. In this study, we first assess the relative importance of patient characteristics with regard to having forgone healthcare due to cost-sharing payments, and then employ qualitative methods in order to understand these findings better. Methods: Survey data was collected from a Dutch panel of regular users of healthcare. Logistic regression models and dominance analyses were performed to assess the relative importance of patient characteristics, i.e., personal characteristics, health, educational level, sense of mastery and financial situation. Semi-structured interviews (n = 5) were conducted with those who had forgone healthcare. The verbatim transcribed interviews were thematically analyzed. Results: Of the 7,339 respondents who completed the questionnaire, 1,048 respondents (14.3%) had forgone healthcare because of the deductible requirement. The regression model indicated that having a higher income reduced the odds of having forgone recommended healthcare due to the deductible (odds ratios of higher income categories relative to the lowest income category (reference): 0.29–0.49). However, dominance analyses revealed that financial leeway was more important than income: financial leeway contributed the most (34.8%) to the model’s overall McFadden’s pseudo-R2 (i.e., 0.123), followed by income (25.6%). Similar results were observed in stratified models and in population weighted models. Qualitative analyses distinguished four main themes that affected the patient’s decision whether to use healthcare: financial barriers, structural barriers related to the complex design of cost-sharing programs, individual considerations of the patient, and the perceived lack of control regarding treatment choices within a given treatment trajectory. Furthermore, “having forgone healthcare” seemed to have a negative connotation. Conclusion: Our findings show that financial leeway is more important than income with respect to having forgone recommended healthcare due to cost-sharing payments, and that other factors such as the perceived necessity of healthcare also matter. Our findings imply that solely adapting cost-sharing programs to income levels will only get one so far. Our study underlines the need for a broader perspective in the design of cost-sharing programs.",BMC Health Services Research,2022-12-01,10.1186/s12913-022-07527-z,0.9691612051596483
Revolutionizing healthcare 5.0: Blockchain-driven optimization of drone-to-everything communication using 5G network for enhanced medical services,"The healthcare industry has witnessed a notable surge in the adoption of drone technology for the swift and efficient transportation of vital medical supplies. In the expansive and uncontrolled realm where drones operate, challenges arise concerning authentication and secure data sharing. In the era of Healthcare 5.0, characterized by the integration of cutting-edge technologies, this article explores a groundbreaking approach to revolutionize medical services through the synergy of blockchain technology, drone-to-everything (D2X) communication, and the upcoming 5G network that provides enhanced broadband, extra reliable, low latency communication and massive machine type communication. This research addresses the critical task of delivering medical supplies using drone technology, focusing on ensuring the security, reliability and demand for a large storage capacity during the transportation of sensitive items. This research introduces an optimized communication link by using a blockchain network and the Internet of Things (IoT). To achieve such a goal two different algorithms are introduced and three different scenarios are implemented to include all possibilities in real applications. Three potential routes for data transmission, drone to drone, drone to ground user devices, and drone to base station, are explored to enhance communication efficiency. The contribution lies in optimizing the communication link to ensure a low bit error rate (BER), high signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR) and maintain fixed signal power during data transmission. The outcomes of this study have significant implications for advancing healthcare logistics through the integration of cutting-edge technologies. The performance of the proposed method has been proven by simulations using parametric measurements.",Technology in Society,2024-06-01,10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102552,0.9585201646260686
Benchmarking of health technologies distribution models: An investigation of Lombardy’s local health authorities,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to develop a benchmarking framework for assessing the performance of the distribution models adopted by the local branches of National Health Services (NHSs) for delivering health technologies to patients at a local level, and to derive prescriptions for enhancing design and optimal management of the distribution models. Design/methodology/approach – The authors focussed the study on the distribution of absorbent devices for incontinence, adopting the analytic hierarchy process as a tool for developing the benchmarking framework. The authors applied the framework to the context of the Italian NHS with respect to the Lombard Local Health Authorities, assessing their performance in terms of operational efficiency and service quality. Findings – The developed framework constitutes a novel contribution, and it allows for generating prescriptions. Through its application to the context studied the authors found that a “one-size-fits-all” distribution model cannot be proposed, as regards both efficiency and effectiveness, since process standardization does not provide benefits or savings in all contexts. Rather, a total landed cost approach in the evaluation of the distribution practices must be adopted. Practical implications – This paper offers to managers and decision makers an innovative approach to the design of distribution models for health technologies. It provides policy makers with prescriptions to develop regulations fostering a comprehensive view of the factors for an optimal health technologies distribution at a local level. Originality/value – Given the dearth of scientific publications focussed on the distribution at the local level of health technologies, this paper significantly contributes to the existing body of knowledge and it offers an innovative framework which can be proficiently replicated in manifold contexts.",Benchmarking,2016-05-03,10.1108/BIJ-12-2013-0123,0.9560988837466353
A way for reducing drug supply chain cost for a hospital district: A case study,"Purpose: This work aims at providing insights to optimise healthcare logistic of the drug management, in order to deal with the healthcare expenditure cut. In this paper the effects of different drug supply chain configurations, on the resulting average stock, service level and Bullwhip effect, of the studied supply chain, is quantitatively assessed. Design/methodology/approach: A case study of an Italian district has been studied, taking into account three echelons: suppliers, central stock, and hospitals. A model of the various supply chain configurations has been created with the use of the simulation. Specifically, 24 supply chain configurations have been examined, stemming from the combination of several supply chain design parameters, namely: transshipment policies (Emergency Lateral Transshipment or Total Inventory Equalization); re-order and inventory management policies (Economic Order Quantity or Economic Order Interval); required service levels (90% or 95%); the number of available vans (one or two). For each configuration, hospital average stock, service level and a “Bullwhip effect” analysis are computed. To know which input variables are statistically significant, a DoE (Design of Experiments) analysis has been executed. Findings: The output of this paper provides useful insights and suggestions to optimize the healthcare logistic and drug supply chain. According to the developed DoE analysis, it can be stated that the introduction of transshipment policies provides important improvement in terms of service and stock levels. To reduce the Bullwhip effect, which results in a service level decreasing, and in a managing stock costs increasing, it is worth to adopt an EOQ re-order policy. Practical implications: This research gives practical recommendations to the studied system, in order to reduce costs and maintain a very satisfactory service level. Originality/value: This paper fulfils an identified need to study which combination of transshipment policies, re-order/inventory management policies and required service levels, can be the best one to reduce costs and maintain a very satisfactory service level, in the specific logistic system.",Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management,2016-01-01,10.3926/jiem.1262,0.9559757711646774
Healthcare service modeling to minimize disruptions due to natural disasters,"The aftermath of any disaster could be enormous and annihilating especially for healthcare industry. In case of an emergency, the healthcare organizations in the affected region may experience out of stock situation for medical supplies which eventually impact their services. Healthcare providers need to replenish their supplies from central distribution centers or unaffected regional distribution centers. The most difficult situation that authorities face is the complexity of operating conditions where they had to work in order to supply medical items to the affected region from a central position. Some regions may be very difficult to reach under disaster condition. In this scenario it may be required to share medical items from contiguous health care organizations. Operations Research techniques have already been proven to be beneficial for different planning situations, mainly during the preparation and the response phase of disaster life cycle. There are very few works that have been done in the field of inventory relocation in case of a disaster. This paper discusses the modeling techniques to minimize the stock out situation of medical supplies in the natural disaster affected zones.",IIE Annual Conference and Expo 2013,2013-01-01,,0.943258768372489
Occupational safety and health and smaller organisations: Research challenges and opportunities,"Despite the prevalence of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and micro organisations, comparatively little is known about how such organisations approach occupational safety and health (OSH). Research has tended to present a negative picture of OSH practices in smaller organisations. This paper discusses some of the challenges to researching OSH in SMEs and micro organisations and how these challenges can be overcome. It draws lessons and experiences from a qualitative study involving 149 structured interviews, nine short-term ethnographies and 21 semi-structured interviews with owners and employees in SMEs and micro organisations from a broad cross-section of industry sectors in the UK, including construction, retail, healthcare, logistics and agriculture. Data from the study suggest that the established boundaries between micro, small and medium-sized enterprises are less meaningful in an OSH context – OSH practices are influenced more by the culture of the organisation, the type of work being undertaken and the sector that an organisation operates in. OSH practices in SMEs and micro organisations tend to reflect more informal characteristics of such organisations, with more emphasis (than many larger organisations) on tacit knowledge, learning by doing and improvisation. Such practices should not necessarily be assumed to be unsafe or incompatible with formalised OSH.",Policy and Practice in Health and Safety,2016-01-01,10.1080/14773996.2016.1239357,0.9361259474314686
The Wings of Wellness: Autonomous Medical Delivery Drones Enhancing Patient Care and Accessibility,"This paper represents the advent of drones, that has rushed in a new era in healthcare logistics by providing a swift and efficient means of medical supply delivery. Access to timely medical supplies is often hampered by traffic congestion, geographical barriers, and unpredictable emergencies. Drones that transport pharmaceuticals have come to be considered as an ideal solution to these issues of concern. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, these autonomous flying machines are capable of transporting medical essentials, such as medications, vaccines, blood samples, and even life-saving equipment, to remote and underserved areas with unparalleled speed and precision. The advantages of using drones, such as reduced transportation time, cost-effectiveness, and minimized human contact during the pandemic, which has been crucial in curbing disease transmission. The future of healthcare delivery is poised to be significantly transformed by medical delivery drones. These innovative aerial vehicles have the potential to bridge healthcare disparities, enhance emergency response, and save countless lives.

The impact of the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Australian trans community,"Background: Trans and gender diverse individuals (people who identify with a gender different to what was presumed for them at birth) are one of the most medically and socially marginalized groups in our community. The COVID-19 pandemic may compound preexisting depression and thoughts of self-harm or suicide. Aim: We aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Australian trans community. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted between 1st May 2020 and 30th June 2020, amidst strict Australia-wide social restrictions. Australian trans people aged ≥16 years were eligible to participate. Survey questions explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on living situation, employment, financial situation, and healthcare. Logistic regression to assess negative impacts due to COVID-19 on depression and thoughts of self-harm or suicide (measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) are presented as odds ratios (95% confidence interval)). Results: Of 1019 participants, 49.6% reported experiencing financial strain, 22% had reduced working hours, and 22.4% were unemployed (three times the national rate). Concerningly, 61.1% experienced clinically significant symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≥10), considerably higher than pre-COVID rates for the trans community and over twice the national rate. Moreover, 49% reported thoughts of self-harm or suicide (over three times the national rate) which was more likely if a person experienced cancelation or postponement of gender-affirming surgery (OR 1.56 (1.04, 2.35)), financial strain (OR 1.80 (1.36, 2.38)), or felt unsafe or afraid in their household (OR 1.96 (1.23, 3.08)). Discussion: Given rates of clinically significant depression and thoughts of self-harm or suicide are far higher in trans people than the general population, specific strategies to improve mental health in the trans community during the COVID-19 pandemic must be made a priority for policymakers, researchers, and health service providers to prevent suicide.

Socio-economic and corporate factors and COVID-19 pandemic: a wake-up call,"The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) emerges from the Chinese city Wuhan and its spread to the rest of the world, primarily affected economies and their businesses, leading to a global depression. The explanatory and cross-sectional regression approach assesses the impact of COVID-19 cases on healthcare expenditures, logistics performance index, carbon damages, and corporate social responsibility in a panel of 77 countries. The results show that COVID-19 cases substantially increase healthcare expenditures and decrease corporate social responsibility. On the other hand, an increase in the coronavirus testing capacity brings positive change in reducing healthcare expenditures, increased logistics activities, and corporate social responsibility. The cost of carbon emissions increases when corporate activities begin to resume. The economic affluence supports logistics activities and improves healthcare infrastructure. It linked to international cooperation and their assistance to supply healthcare logistics traded equipment through mutual trade agreements. The greater need to enhance global trade and healthcare logistics supply helps minimize the sensitive coronavirus cases that are likely to provide a safe and healthy environment for living.",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,2021-11-01,10.1007/s11356-021-15275-6,0.9104531574076751
Strategy deployment in healthcare services: A case study approach,"For a number of years, multiple studies have suggested that the effective management of logistics can generate significant gains for healthcare institutions. Yet, the studies also show that despite widespread knowledge of best practices, most institutions struggle to deploy practices that can enhance the logistics performance of their organization. In fact, healthcare institution managers are lacking guidelines enabling them to deploy a logistics strategy supporting the implementation of such practices. Using longitudinal case studies of two Canadian hospitals that made significant improvements in this regard, we will analyze the deployment strategy for exemplary materials management practices. In these studies, we will consider that two aspects are essential in deploying a logistics strategy in a service undertaking. First, there must be well-defined strategic intent. Based on this, the organization must implement an experimental series of logistics practices. This implementation process offers two benefits: 1) it should enable innovative practices to be tested, and 2) it should provide the organization with the time to absorb these innovations, particularly given the complex environment within a hospital.",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2016-12-01,10.1016/j.techfore.2016.09.006,0.8979722689311381
A Locational Analysis Model of the COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution,"Even and equitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine becomes one of key strategies to reduce the number of positive cases and virus transmissions all over the world. This paper aims to introduce and demonstrate a mathematical model based on a maximal covering location problem (MCLP) to optimise the coverage of the COVID-19 vaccine distribution. A mathematical model is proposed and demonstrated using an illustrative case study of healthcare facilities and location coordinates of villages in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. A numerical computer experiment is conducted to obtain optimal results of the locational analysis. The results show that the proposed model provides an efficient coverage of vaccination by minimising the distances travelled by the target population. It also reveals an interesting insight that prioritising vaccination for areas with high COVID-19 cases results in a less efficient coverage. The novel location-allocation model for COVID-19 vaccination facilities proposed in this paper particularly applies in a developing country. The model could be used as an alternative way to increase the vaccination coverage and priority whilst minimising the potential risks of the virus transmissions and transport costs.",Operations and Supply Chain Management,2022-01-01,10.31387/oscm0490344,0.8974221208280564
Bridging the Performance Gap Between Two-Way and One-Way CSI-Based 5 GHz WiFi Ranging,"Indoor Localization is gaining increased importance due to numerous location-based services in healthcare, logistics, and security, to name few, that are expected to be provided by next-generation wireless networks. Such services are characterized by stringent accuracy requirements, short response time, and lower cost which makes the localization problem more challenging and deserving of attention. A key element of the localization process is distance estimation (also known as ranging). In this paper, we design and analyze an efficient decimeter-level two-way ranging scheme for ubiquitous WiFi networks in the 5 GHz frequency band whose accuracy approaches ideal one-way ranging with no phase mismatches. We investigate the idea of channel frequency response (CFR) stitching across non-contiguous WiFi channels and how two-way CFR measurements help in achieving the CFR coherency necessary for accurate ranging. In addition, we quantify the decrease in ranging accuracy of two-way compared to one-way ranging due to SNR degradation, Line-of-Sight (LoS) component shrinkage, and doubling the multipath delay spread. Furthermore, We design a novel scheme to bridge the performance gap between two-way ranging and ideal one-way ranging which operates in three main steps: square-root of the two-way CFR, followed by phase unwrapping, and finally deep fade detection and phase errors correction. Our proposed scheme achieves significant performance gains over two-way ranging with only a slight performance gap from ideal one-way ranging. Moreover, our proposed scheme enjoys robustness as it preserves the ranging accuracy gains in various WiFi communication scenarios when operating at different SNR levels, different multipath channel models, and different CFR bandwidths, as well as operating under system impairments such as Sample Timing Offset (STO). The accuracy gains achieved by the proposed schemes are demonstrated using both simulations and an in-house WiFi testbed. Finally, we quantify the added complexity of our proposed scheme and show it to be insignificant compared to that of the MUSIC super-resolution ranging steps which confirms the practical viability of our proposed scheme.",IEEE Access,2023-01-01,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3287850,0.8828884170745933
Logistical and structural challenges are the major obstacles for family medicine physicians’ ability to administer adult vaccines,"Purpose: This study was conducted to characterize the vaccination practices and challenges of family medicine physicians in Los Angeles County, California. Methods: The Los Angeles Academy of Family Physicians (LA AFP) sent out electronic surveys to all of their active members (N = 1121) between December 2017 and January 2018, and asked them to answer questions about themselves, their practice, their patient population, and their immunization practices and challenges. We then analyzed the results through basic statistical calculations and Pearson’s chi-squared tests. Results: Seventy-four people (6.6%) responded to the survey, and 75% of responders stated that they administer all Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended vaccines. The lowest vaccine administration rates were for the high-dose influenza vaccine, which 66.2% (n = 49) of respondents reported to administer, followed by the meningococcal B vaccine (68.9%; n = 51). The respondents who belonged to practices with more than 11 providers, were part of a large hospital or healthcare system, had electronic medical records (EMRs), and used the California Immunization Registry (CAIR) were more likely to report to vaccinate. The number one responding physician-reported challenge to vaccination was limited time and resources to address patient resistance followed by vaccine cost and lack of infrastructure to store vaccines. Conclusions: In this pilot study, structural and logistical challenges appeared to make the biggest impact on adult vaccination for the responding family medicine physicians. Solutions addressing these challenges will help improve the adult immunization rates.",Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics,2019-03-04,10.1080/21645515.2018.1543524,0.8771569828916929

Nonmedical barriers to early steps in kidney transplantation among underrepresented groups in the United States,"Purpose of reviewDespite numerous targeted interventions and policy reforms, underrepresented minorities and patients with low socioeconomic status (SES) continue to have unequal a to kidney transplant. In this review, we summarize the most recent evidence on barriers to early kidney transplant steps (i.e. referral and evaluation) among underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities and low SES groups in the United States.Recent findingsThis review highlights the interconnectedness of several patient-level (e.g. medical mistrust, transplant knowledge, a to care), provider-level (e.g. dialysis profit status, patient-provider communication; staff aibility), and system-level (e.g. center-specific criteria, healthcare logistics, neighborhood poverty, healthcare logistics) factors associated with lower rates of referral and evaluation among underrepresented minorities and low SES groups, and the influence of systemic racism operating at all levels.SummaryCollection of national surveillance data on early transplant steps, as well as routinely captured data on upstream social determinants of health, including the measurement of racism rather than race, is necessary to enhance our understanding of barriers to referral and evaluation. A multipronged approach (e.g.Targeted and systemwide interventions, and policy change) implemented at multiple levels of the healthcare system will be necessary to reduce disparities in early transplant steps.",Current Opinion in Organ Transplantation,2021-10-01,10.1097/MOT.0000000000000903,0.8626555675146031
Transforming healthcare logistics and evaluating current use cases of UAVs (drones) as a method of transportation in healthcare to generate recommendations for the NHS to use drone technology at scale: a narrative review,"Drones have been pioneered and used in the military, however, only recently non-military drones have been introduced. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into focus the potential value of drones in moving medical supplies. With the onset of social distancing policies and quarantine regulations, the efficiency of traditional logistics systems has been limited. Several companies have recently accelerated their development in this domain, conducting pilot projects at pace, paving the way for the future of the medical logistics supply chain. In this review, we examine both narrative and grey literature for in and out of hospital settings, in order to describe the current state of drone technology in healthcare around the world and some of the most cutting-edge examples of how drones can benefits patients, clinicians and the wider public. We investigate the economic viability and barriers to adopting drones at scale which include regulatory hurdles, public perception and safety of drone technologies, and propose how to overcome these challenges. Further work should look at quantifying the impact and outcomes of how such a service could impact the health outcomes of patients and clinical efficiency. This review aims to equip the National Health Service and more broadly other healthcare systems around the world with the tools to embrace and implement this novel and upcoming technology.",BMJ Innovations,2023-01-01,10.1136/bmjinnov-2021-000861,0.8601181099035733
Healthcare Logistics Optimization Framework for Efficient Supply Chain Management in Niger Delta Region of Nigeria,"Optimizing logistics allocation and utilization is essential for effective healthcare management. Apparently, less consideration is given to it in most hospitals in Nigeria where less resources are allocated to health sector in yearly budgetary. Hospital consists of several patient classes, each of which follows different treatment process flow paths over a multiphase and multidimensional requirement with scarce resources and inadequate space. Despite the small budget provision made for healthcare resources, patient’s demands for better service is rapidly experiencing upsurge. Hence, efficient and optimal solutions are required to lessen costs of healthcare service towards enhancing Quality of Care (QoC) and Quality of Experience (QoE) in most public healthcare sector. However, certain control coefficients like the absence of a Dedicated Logistics Department (DLD) in the medical facilities actually limit the efforts of stakeholders. This paper proposed a Computational framework to assess various strategic and operational decisions for optimizing the multiple objectives using Type-1 Fuzzy Logic Model. In phase I, we explore healthcare resource allocation plan. In phase II, we determine a resource utilization schedule by patient class for daily operational level. While in Phase III, we develop a framework capable of evaluating and optimizing healthcare logistics using control coefficients of Logistics Optimization (LO), Integration of Information/Cognitive Technologies (ETA), and Collaboration of all Logistics Stakeholders (COL). We assigned weights between 1 and 10 to the coefficients and modeled the effects on efficient supply chain. Finally, we further explore the effects of separate strategies and their combination to identify the best possible resource supply chain. The computational experiment was considered on the basis of data obtained from a study conducted on a typical public healthcare department. Results shows that our approach significantly evaluate and optimized healthcare logistics.",International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,2021-01-01,10.14569/IJACSA.2021.0120475,0.8589120932910919
Request and Donation Efficiencies in a Crisis: Data Envelopment Analyses of a Philippine Web-Based Emergency Response System,"On March 16, 2020, the island of Luzon was placed under lockdown to curtail the spread of COVID-19 in the Philippines. Soon thereafter, a web-based emergency response platform was developed to counteract effects from the outbreak. As a free service to strengthen a debilitated national hospital supply chain, the platform connected community organizations (as hospitals) with donors (individuals). From concepts and techniques that addressed information flows in healthcare logistics and supply chain management, several input-oriented data envelopment analyses were conducted to find the efficiencies for each of the 75 hospitals serviced by the website in terms of donors, individual items requested, total quantity of items requested, number of requested individual items that received a pledged, and average days a request pended to fulfillment. Results from the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique found that hospitals on the platform made requests that exceeded optimal quantities of inputs from donors. Further, hospital requests aggregated at the city-level stood unanswered an average of 14.39 days for inefficiently served cities. Findings from the analyses produced three recommendations to improve the web-based emergency response system service efficiency. The first recommendation was to reallocate donors over more hospitals, such that a few hospitals did not receive a majority of donations. A second recommendation was to reduce the number of individually requested items. The third recommendation was to reduce the quantities of items requested in order to bring service efficiency to optimality.",Contributions to Economics,2022-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-89996-7_20,0.8543977751737503

Mathematical model and exact algorithm for the home care worker scheduling and routing problem with lunch break requirements,"Home health care or home care (HHC/HC) refers to the delivery of social, medical and paramedical services to clients in their own homes. Each day, care workers start from the HHC/HC centre, visit some clients and return to the centre. During the service delivery process, there is usually a lunch break for each worker. In this paper, we address a real-life home care worker scheduling and routing problem with the consideration of lunch break requirements. A three-index mathematical model is constructed for the problem. The problem is decomposed into a master problem and several pricing sub-problems, and is optimally solved by a branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm. Specifically, a sophisticated label-correcting algorithm is designed to address lunch break constraints in pricing sub-problems; some cutting-edge acceleration strategies are applied during the column generation process. Experimental results show that the proposed B&P algorithm is able to produce satisfied solutions within an acceptable runtime and outperforms the mixed integer programming solver CPLEX.",International Journal of Production Research,2017-01-17,10.1080/00207543.2016.1213917,0.844097529234787

Future healthcare logistics: a survey of the public opinion on drones in Denmark,"Drones are expected to become widespread in society, making public readiness an important prerequisite for successfully unleashing them. This article investigates Danish citizens’ opinions on drones across varying fields of application and, specif-ically, six potential cases of healthcare logistics. Survey data representative of age, gender, and geography were collected and included information about respondents’ background, knowledge level of drones, and opinions on different drone use cases. Data were analysed with frequency tables and bivariate cross-tabulation. A thousand and four Danish adults completed the survey. Although other fields of application received higher levels of support, a majority of the respondents were positive towards using drones for healthcare logistics. Transportation of medicine and blood samples between hospitals were the most accepted healthcare use cases. Support varies across age with the highest support found in the eldest age group. Also, the more citizens report to know about drones, the more they tend to support using them. The results suggest that policymakers and firms must be attentive towards the public opinion on drones and seek insights into what citizens regard as noble purposes of using drones. Moreover, citizens must become more acquainted with drones, as this will likely boost public support.",Drone Systems and Applications,2023-01-01,10.1139/dsa-2022-0050,0.8240854649167241
Logistics practices in healthcare organizations in Bogota,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the current state of logistics practices in healthcare organizations in Bogota, Colombia. Design/methodology/approach: The assessment is based on case study research using open interviews, focused interviews, a questionnaire and direct observations as sources of evidence.

A case study of collaborative communications within healthcare logistics,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a collaborative communications model developed during the conduct of a recent academic research study and provide information to healthcare supply chain managers and administrators. Design/methodology/approach: Using data collected from a case study involving healthcare supply chain managers in the United States Army, this work examines how collaborative communications is linked to healthcare supply chain management. The findings associated with this study may have many transferable applications to institutions beyond a military health services context. Findings: This paper presents the findings and conclusions ascertained during a case study of collaborative communications. Five emerging themes were identified and a management model was developed for the enhancement of healthcare supply chain operations. Emerging themes included synergy among organizations, stakeholders working together, enhancements in supply chain operations, a continuance of training for supply chain leaders, and commonalities among disparate levels of management. Practical implications: Healthcare is a continually evolving industry. Supply chain efficiency can be linked to potential cost savings and more efficient operations within healthcare organizations. By understanding a model related to communicating collaboratively, leaders begin to understand the need for partnering among internal and external stakeholders and creating more efficient practices and processes. While this discussion is directed specifically toward healthcare management, the principles are applicable across a wide array of industries. Social implications: Communicating effectively is never easy for any healthcare organization or staff. Whether isolated to key individuals or throughout the entire organization, leaders have an inherent responsibility to share information and set conditions for organizational success. Arguably, the critical path to success involves effective, collaborative communications across multiple echelons of management responsibilities. Originality/value: While there is a dearth of literature examining communications and collaboration among various industries, little information is directed specifically toward the management of healthcare organizations or supply chain operations. In an applied sense, this model provides healthcare supply chain managers with concepts related to communicating more effectively at both the individual and organizational levels. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Leadership in Health Services,2011-02-01,10.1108/17511871111102526,0.7988538463536758

"Logistics for a fleet of drones for medical item delivery: A case study for Louisville, KY","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, commonly referred to as drones, have been widely acknowledged as a promising technology for the delivery of medical and aid packages in humanitarian and healthcare logistics. In this study, we develop an optimization model to optimize the logistics for a fleet of drones for timely delivery of medical items (e.g., medicines, test kits, and vaccines) to hard-to-access locations (i.e., rural and suburban areas). We propose a novel timeslot formulation that schedules and sequences a set of trips to serve several demand locations. On each trip, a drone starts from an urban provider, visits one or more charging platforms (if required), serves a clinic in rural or suburban areas, and returns to the corresponding provider. The problem consists of selecting locations for charging stations, assigning clinics to providers, and scheduling and sequencing the trips such that the total completion time to serve all demand points is minimized. To improve the computational efficiency of the solution method, we use a preprocessing procedure to reduce the solution space by eliminating the dominated trips from the pool of trips. A set of numerical experiments is performed on simulated instances and on a case study in Louisville, KY. The results unveil interesting insights into the logistics of the proposed drone delivery system.",Computers and Operations Research,2021-11-01,10.1016/j.cor.2021.105443,0.7943853455962971
"Prioritizing interdependent drivers of financial, economic, and political risks using a data-driven probabilistic approach","Financial, economic, and political risks pose a significant threat to the development and progress of countries as such risks can impact all spheres of life including education, healthcare, logistics, transportation, and safety among others. Although these risks seem quite distinct, they are mutually influenced by multidimensional interdependent factors such as internal and external conflict, socioeconomic conditions, corruption, law and order, and bureaucratic quality among others. In this paper, we utilize a data-driven approach to explore dependencies among factors influencing financial, economic, and political risks and establish their relative importance in a network setting while capturing the entire distribution of individual factors. A probabilistic network-based model was developed using the data by the International Country Risk Guide, which revealed significant differences between the conventional and the proposed schemes for prioritizing drivers of political, economic, and financial risks. Internal conflict and socioeconomic conditions were considered as the most critical factors in terms of reducing and enhancing the network-wide risk exposure, respectively. The two prioritization schemes relative to the vulnerability and resilience impact of individual factors are not correlated and therefore, policy-makers need to focus on both schemes while developing risk mitigation strategies.",Risk Management,2022-06-01,10.1057/s41283-022-00089-8,0.7942495009730142
Stochastic medical tourism problem with variable residence time considering gravity function,"Medical tourism is a recent term in healthcare logistics referring to travel of patients to receive health services and spending leisure time in a destination country. This transferring of patients leads to access high-quality health services which are cheaper than the original country of patients. During this travel, passengers who are the patients from another country, have this opportunity for complimentary entertainment packages (e.g., pleasure tours) in the aftercare period. As far as we know, the term of medical tourism is rarely studied in healthcare logistics and such services are highly important for developing countries. Such facts motivate us to develop a practical optimization model for the Medical Tour Centers (MTCs) for allocation of patients to hospitals in proper time and creation of memorable aftercare time for them. In this regard, the main aim of the proposed model is to maximize the total profit of MTCs through optimal allocation of patients to hospitals while considering an aftercare tour for the passengers. To make the proposed model more realistic, the optimal residence time in attractive places is simulated by a time-dependent gravity function. To address the uncertainty of medical tourism problem, a scenario-based two-stage stochastic optimization approach is extended to encounter different sources of uncertainty existing in surgical success, medical time, restoration restrictions, and the attraction of tourist places. Another novelty of this work is to propose an innovative hybrid meta-heuristic for large-scale instances, which is a combination of Progressive Hedging Algorithm (PHA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The model is analyzed by different test problems for small, medium, and large-scale instances where the hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm could solve them with an average gap of 3.4% in comparison with the commercial solver. The results revealed the importance of tourist opinion and public preferences in medical and pleasure tours, respectively, to improve the economic growth in this sector in developing countries.",RAIRO - Operations Research,2022-05-01,10.1051/ro/2022082,0.7866877030090018
Optimising the booking horizon in healthcare clinics considering no-shows and cancellations,"Patient no-shows and cancellations are a significant problem to healthcare clinics, as they compromise a clinic's efficiency. Therefore, it is important to account for both no-shows and cancellations into the design of appointment systems. To provide additional empirical evidence on no-show and cancellation behaviour, we assess outpatient clinic data from two healthcare providers in the USA and EU: no-show and cancellation rates increase with the scheduling interval, which is the number of days from the appointment creation to the date the appointment is scheduled for. We show the temporal cancellation behaviour for multiple scheduling intervals is bimodally distributed. To improve the efficiency of clinics at a tactical level of control, we determine the optimal booking horizon such that the impact of no-shows and cancellations through high scheduling intervals is minimised, against a cost of rejecting patients. Where the majority of the literature only includes a fixed no-show rate, we include both a cancellation rate and a time-dependent no-show rate. We propose an analytical queuing model with balking and reneging, to determine the optimal booking horizon. Simulation experiments show that the assumptions of this model are viable. Computational results demonstrate general applicability of our model by case studies of two hospitals.",International Journal of Production Research,2022-01-01,10.1080/00207543.2021.1913292,0.7865669721172377
Paving the way for warehouse centralization in healthcare: A preliminary assessment approach,"Centralized logistics management is currently one interesting option for healthcare systems facing an increasing need to improve responsiveness and service quality while reducing costs. This work focuses on one aspect of centralized logistics, namely warehouse centralization and proposes a preliminary approach to assess material management in healthcare institutions as a first step towards decisions about the implementation of such a strategy. A list of variables and relationships between them characterizing warehouse material management are identified based on a literature review and knowledge of real logistics processes. Statistical analysis is then applied to assess the existence of such relationships in a set of healthcare organizations in order to understand the management commonalities that can stimulate warehouse centralization as well as the criticalities that could potentially hinder it. The approach is tested in a healthcare logistics system in Northern Italy. The results proved the ability of the methodology to identify the relevant issues the involved institutions need to work on when undertaking warehouse centralization strategies. The case warehouses revealed a good degree of commonalities in their management practices although three critical aspects were identified, namely a limited efficiency in human resource allocation, a high fragmentation of stock product demand and a relevant number of stock products with low annual demand. This work provides a methodology to increase material managers’ awareness about the factors enabling successful centralized inventory strategies in the healthcare sector.",American Journal of Applied Sciences,2016-05-05,10.3844/ajassp.2016.490.500,0.7550326787741558

Fleet sizing and routing of healthcare automated guided vehicles,"This paper proposes techniques to improve the efficiency of transportation activities within hospitals. Transportation is a major activity in hospitals which requires management efforts to improve its efficiency and increase the quality of patient services. One of the most powerful ways of achieving more efficiency of transportation systems in hospitals is via the labor-saving technology of logistics processes using automated guided vehicles (AGVs). In this paper, we study the fleet sizing and routing problem with synchronization for AGVs with dynamic demands (FSRPS-AGV) in the context of a real-life application. The goal is to simultaneously optimize the number and types of carts and AGVs needed to perform all daily requests in a hospital while optimizing AGVs’ routes and respecting time constraints. Different requests require different types of carts, which are transported by the AGVs. Each request is composed of several tasks consisting of moving material from a pickup point to a delivery point. Operation synchronization among the tasks of the same request (task 1 must be performed before task 2, possibly by different AGVs but using the same cart) and movement synchronization with respect to AGVs and carts (an AGV may drop off a cart, and later another AGV picks up the cart to continue serving the same or another request) are major challenges of the addressed problem. In this paper, we describe, model, and solve the FSRPS-AGV. We introduce a mathematical formulation and propose a powerful matheuristic based on a fast and efficient dynamic reoptimization of the routes upon the arrival of new requests. We compare the performance of our matheuristic under different scenarios, including against the solutions obtained by an oracle, showing that it can handle dynamism of demand very well and achieve near-optimal solutions. We assess our methods using small and large instances generated based on real data from an industrial partner. We demonstrate that significant performance improvements and important savings can be achieved with a small degree of flexibility in timing constraints and less conservative speed estimations (while taking into account safety concerns). Finally, we provide managerial insights with respect to the number of AGVs and carts that should be acquired by our industrial partner.",Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,2022-05-01,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102679,0.7484239223357226
Enhancing COVID-19 vaccination and medication distribution routing strategies in rural regions of Morocco: A comparative metaheuristics analysis,"The optimization of the vaccination campaign and medication distribution in rural regions of Morocco conducted by the Ministry of Health can be significantly improved by employing metaheuristic algorithms in conjunction with a tour planning system. This research proposes the utilization of six metaheuristic algorithms: genetic algorithm, rat swarm optimization, whale optimization, spotted hyena optimizer, penguins search optimization, and particle swarm optimization, to determine the most efficient routes for equipped trucks carrying vaccines and medications. These algorithms consider critical field constraints, such as operating hours of vaccination centers, vaccine availability, and distances between centers while minimizing the overall journey duration. In addition, a comprehensive tour planning system is integrated into the optimization framework accounting for transportation costs such as fuel expenses and truck maintenance costs. By incorporating these factors, the Ministry of Health aims to achieve the maximum efficiency while minimizing the financial burden associated with the vaccination campaign in rural areas. The integration of metaheuristics and the tour planning system presents a robust and data-driven solution for the Ministry of Health to enhance the effectiveness of their vaccination and medication distribution campaigns in rural regions of Morocco. This approach not only minimizes costs but also improves overall efficiency by ensuring timely access to vaccines and medications for the rural population.

Home healthcare in Spanish rural areas: Applying vehicle routing algorithms to health transport management,"Depopulation of rural areas poses a range of new challenges for the provision of public services. Access to primary care centres is essential for promoting and protecting quality of life, especially for the older population. However, many rural municipalities face abandonment from public administrations by not even having a local clinic and forcing their dwellers to drive to the nearest facility. This research examines the adequacy of providing home healthcare (HHC) systems in such areas to avoid unnecessary trips. When designing routes to provide these services, decision-makers must take into account the following: (i) wide geographical spread of places to visit; (ii) difficulty in accessing some of these places with heavy medically equipped vehicles; and (iii) uncertainty regarding places to visit and availability of professionals. Our study identifies municipalities in which the travelling distance to the closest centre is above a desirable threshold, estimating the magnitude of the problem. Then, we provide an illustrative example in which an agile methodology is presented to design efficient routes that allow policymakers to offer HHC services of reasonable quality.",Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,2024-04-01,10.1016/j.seps.2024.101828,0.6860352712137624

Medrone,"In order to address the pressing healthcare challenges faced by isolated communities in remote regions, this project proposes the development of an innovative Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a focus on autonomous navigation, advanced object detection, and collision avoidance systems for efficient and reliable delivery of life-saving medicines and equipment. The UAV will be equipped with autonomous navigation capabilities, allowing it to operate without direct human intervention. This is particularly crucial in regions lacking proper infrastructure, where manual control may be impractical. The autonomous system will utilize GPS technology to ensure precise navigation and route planning, optimizing the efficiency of medical deliveries. To enhance the UAV's capability to operate in unpredictable environments, object detection systems will be integrated. This technology will enable the UAV to identify and navigate around obstacles such as trees, buildings, or uneven terrain. Utilizing a combination of cameras and ultrasonic sensors, the UAV will continuously scan its surroundings, making real-time decisions to avoid collisions and ensure a safe and reliable delivery path. The UAV's collision avoidance system will go beyond simple obstacle detection by actively predicting potential collision scenarios and taking preventive measures. This real-time decision-making process will be essential for navigating through challenging geographical landscapes like mountains and forests. In addition to its navigation and obstacle avoidance capabilities, the UAV will be equipped with a package deployment mechanism. This system will allow for the precise and controlled release of medical supplies at designated delivery points, ensuring that essential resources reach their intended destinations accurately and safely. By combining these cutting-edge technologies, the proposed UAV aims to revolutionize healthcare logistics in hard-to-reach areas, providing timely and efficient delivery of medical supplies to communities in need.

This will help to improve the supply chain performance so that reflects on the patient outcomes. Lack of efficient storage areas, increasing wages/salaries, and some activities that are conducted by healthcare employees manually are the priority areas that require solutions. According to studies in the field of health logistics, supply chain activities take more than the time spent on patient care. In addition, the logistics activities that have to be done manually by the health personnel leave a negative impression on the patients. Based on these, healthcare logistics should be improved in order to decrease the level of fatigue of healthcare personnel and create more time to interact with patients. Serving various tasks and purposes in many business sector, robots are preparing to become one of the most important technological innovations for healthcare industry. Nowadays, the robotics community is largely focused on developing the next generation of service and social robots. It is predicted that the use of robots in diagnostics, surgery, rehabilitation, patient care, disinfection and cleaning, medicine and food distribution, vital signs measurement, disease prevention, and disease management will increase performance in healthcare services. Among these, robots providing disinfection and logistics services are predicted to have the shortest-term impact.","Accounting, Finance, Sustainability, Governance and Fraud",2023-01-01,10.1007/978-981-99-1818-8_7,0.6588679291217648
Oral anticoagulant treatment: A cost-benefit study,"More than 1% of the population are on oral anticoagulant treatment (OAT), a figure which is growing by over 10% annually. The demand for the clinical and analytical services necessary for monitoring this treatment requires the assignment of significant economical and healthcare logistic resources. Comparative studies of the multiple control strategies (attending hospital, primary care or self-monitoring) should be set up, and should reflect not only the costs of their performance but also their clinical results, measures such as mortality and morbidity of thrombotic and haemorrhagic episodes that, have occurred and been avoided. During 2003,20,347 patients on OAT were monitored in 4 anticoagulation units of large national hospitals providing healthcare cover to 1,641,914 inhabitants, Thrombotic or haemorrhagic episodes were recorded and the same events that should have occurred, according to their pathologies, were calculated. Two hundred and ninety-nine thromboembolic complications occurred which led to 129 hospital admissions and there were 11 deaths. Serious haemorrhagic complications resulted in IBI hospital admissions and caused 20 deaths. The costs of OAT in the population attended (medication and their clinical/analytical monitoring) were estimated at €2,749,813,The healthcare costs (calculated according to the DRG of the pathologies) of the clinical complications which occurred were estimated at €1,068,259. The complications avoided were calculated at. more than 100 deaths, 1,044 cerebrovascular accidents and 583 thrombotic recurrences with estimated costs, in the acute intrahospital phase only, of greater than €5,000,000.",Revista de Administracion Sanitaria,2008-07-01,,0.6538309920509603
Develop the healthcare logistics service with kano model,"With the advancement of information and communication technologies in the healthcare industry and the strong growth in the sales of temperature sensitive healthcare products, the demand for cold chain logistics service has increased greatly in recent years. Therefore, developing an effective logistics service model for cold chain logistics is essential to help enterprises improve logistics quality and reduce cost. This study aims at applying the five dimensions of service quality (SERVQUAL) model to construct the service elements that customers are concerned about, and then applied the Kano model to categorize the service elements. For analyzing customers’ needs, primary data were collected from a survey administered to respondents who have used a logistics service for healthcare products. Through the convenient sampling, a total of 101 effective paper-based survey questionnaires were received for analysis. From the classification results, 2 service elements are classified as attractive elements, 8 service elements are classified as must-be elements, 15 services elements are classified as one-dimensional elements, 1 service elements is classified as an indifferent element, and no service elements are classified as reverse element in this study. Specifically, this study identified the service elements that need to be modified in the future pursuit of a more innovative service model, to develop a new cold chain logistics service for healthcare that better satisfies customers and creates and maintains a competitive advantage. Practitioners and researchers in the field of cold chain logistics may refer to this study’s findings of customers’ needs and classified service elements with the Kano model to assist in developing new logistics service model.",Journal of Quality,2019-01-01,10.6220/joq.201902_26(1).0001,0.6530447133369554
Central Hospital Location and Distribution Planning Using Integrated K-Means and Vehicle Routing Algorithm in the Healthcare Chain,"A healthcare chain (HC) involves interrelated activities inclusive of medicine manufacturing, storage, and last-mile distribution to drug retailers and users. Major decision-makers in the HC are also interrelated, in which proper management and planning for logistics activities are required to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. In this study, we first investigate the optimal locations of central hospitals using the K-means algorithm at the midstream of the healthcare chain for long-term planning. Next, we assess the distribution plan of medical supplies by integrating the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) model with a limited time planning horizon, in which the total economic aspect is evaluated for the short-term plan. Then, our integrated framework is applied to a case study of existing hospitals in Thailand to verify and validate model functionalities. We then examine both locational and distribution plans and present our findings using the geographic information system (GIS). The sensitivity analysis is further performed to evaluate the clustering classification scheme for central hospitals and to evaluate the impact on healthcare logistics plans.",Operations and Supply Chain Management,2024-01-01,10.31387/oscm0570429,0.6505057795158105
AI-Enabled Techniques for Intelligent Transportation System for Smarter Use of the Transport Network for Healthcare Services,"Although intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and e-healthcare are two different fields, they can be integrated to offer a seamless and efficient experience to patients, attendants, relatives, and other relevant individuals. ITS can play a crucial role in supporting healthcare services by optimizing the use of transportation networks for treatment and e-healthcare logistic purposes. The combination of ITS and e-healthcare can provide patients with better and more efficient healthcare while also improving the overall transport experience. The biggest challenge in this integration is addressing the existing issues of a complex transportation system. Traffic administration organizations worldwide face the challenge of managing road traffic and networks. ITS, being an excellent mix of data and correspondence systems, seems the best solution that could contribute toward an effective and safe logistic environment alongside the long-term feasibility of transportation systems. For quicker implementation of ITS, electronic media, hardware, programming tools, and automation are necessary. The support of specific specializations such as civil, electrical, mechanical, and industrial engineering might additionally contribute to ensuring that these technologies prove productive and supportive. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) offers immense opportunities for enhancing the effectiveness of various areas and ventures, including the transportation sector. Recently, an advanced computational algorithm that imitates the human brain has been introduced by AI. The information, communications, and control (ICT) technology could also be utilized to make the transportation system more effective, smooth, and safety oriented. These steps will act as the base for the fusion of ITS and e-healthcare, which will assist in reducing the medical support response time to routine and critical patients and in further developing public interest in ITS-based healthcare support. A detailed perspective of AI-based ITS merging with e-healthcare is covered in this chapter.",Blockchain and Deep Learning for Smart Healthcare,2024-01-01,,0.6458897910785195
Sustainable and Robust Home Healthcare Logistics: A Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Today, research on healthcare logistics is an important challenge in developing and developed countries, especially when a pandemic such as COVID-19 occurs. The responses required during such a pandemic would benefit from an efficiently designed model for robust and sustainable healthcare logistics. In this study, we focus on home healthcare logistics and services for planning the routing and scheduling of caregivers to visit patients’ homes. Due to the need for social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, these services are highly applicable for reducing the growth of the epidemic. In addition to this challenge, home healthcare logistics and services must be redesigned to meet the standards of a triple bottom line approach based on sustainable development goals. A triple bottom line approach finds a balance between economic, environmental, and social criteria for making a sustainable decision. Although, recently, the concept of green home healthcare has been studied based on the total cost and green emissions of home healthcare logistics and services, as far as we know, no research has been conducted on the formulation of a triple bottom line approach for home healthcare logistics and services. To achieve social justice for caregivers, the goal of balancing working time is to find a balance between unemployment time and overtime. Another contribution of this research is to develop a scenario-based robust optimization approach to address the uncertainty of home healthcare logistics and services and to assist with making robust decisions for home healthcare planning. Since our multi-objective optimization model for sustainable and robust home healthcare logistics and services is more complex than other studies, the last novel contribution of this research is to establish an efficient heuristic algorithm based on the Lagrangian relaxation theory. An initial solution is found by defining three heuristic algorithms. Our heuristic algorithms use a symmetric pattern for allocating patients to pharmacies and planning the routing of caregivers. Then, a combination of the epsilon constraint method and the Lagrangian relaxation theory is proposed to generate high-quality Pareto-based solutions in a reasonable time period. Finally, an extensive analysis is done to show that our multi-objective optimization model and proposed heuristic algorithm are efficient and practical, as well as some sensitivities are studied to provide some managerial insights for achieving sustainable and robust home healthcare services in practice.",Symmetry,2022-02-01,10.3390/sym14020193,0.6438120726906816
Performance evaluation of FIWARE: A cloud-based IoT platform for smart cities,"As the Internet of Things (IoT) becomes a reality, millions of devices will be connected to IoT platforms in smart cities. These devices will cater to several areas within a smart city such as healthcare, logistics, and transportation. These devices are expected to generate significant amounts of data requests at high data rates, therefore, necessitating the performance benchmarking of IoT platforms to ascertain whether they can efficiently handle such devices. In this article, we present our results gathered from extensive performance evaluation of the cloud-based IoT platform, FIWARE. In particular, to study FIWARE's performance, we developed a testbed and generated CoAP and MQTT data to emulate large-scale IoT deployments, crucial for future smart cities. We performed extensive tests and studied FIWARE's performance regarding vertical and horizontal scalability. We present bottlenecks and limitations regarding FIWARE components and their cloud deployment. Finally, we discuss cost-efficient FIWARE deployment strategies that can be extremely beneficial to stakeholders aiming to deploy FIWARE as an IoT platform for smart cities.",Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,2019-10-01,10.1016/j.jpdc.2018.12.010,0.6417450882547409
A structured review of quantitative models of the pharmaceutical supply chain,"The aim of this review is to identify and provide a structured overview of quantitative models in the pharmaceutical supply chain, a subject not exhaustively studied in the previous reviews on healthcare logistics related mostly to quantitative models in healthcare or logistics studies in hospitals. The models are classified into three categories of classification: network design, inventory models, and optimization of a pharmaceutical supply chain. A taxonomy for each category is shown describing the principal features of each echelon included in the review; this taxonomy allows the readers to identify easily a paper based on the actors of the pharmaceutical supply chain. The search process included research articles published in the databases between 1984 and November 2016. In total 46 studies were included. In the review process we found that in the three fields the most common source of uncertainty used is the demand in the 56% of the cases. Within the review process we can conclude that most of the articles in the literature are focused on the optimization of the pharmaceutical supply chain and inventory models but the field on supply chain network design is not deeply studied.",Complexity,2017-01-01,10.1155/2017/5297406,0.6368025666364459
Red cell storage,"Blood component storage allows the donor and recipient to be separated in time and space. This separation converts transfusion from a desperate clinical act into a planned, orderly healthcare logistic activity with concomitant increases in both blood product availability and safety. However, storage has the potential to reduce the efficacy of transfused blood components by reducing their flow, functional capacity, and survival. Storage time also allows the accumulation of leaked potassium from red cells and the growth of contaminating bacteria. Many different aspects of the red cell storage lesion have been described, including changes in metabolism, shape, and rheology changes, loss of membrane carbohydrates, lipids and proteins, and alterations in secretion, oxygen delivery, and adhesion. What has been harder to show is that these known changes have significant clinical effects. Therefore, regulatory decisions about product storage have been conservative, and largely based on historic patterns of use. The increasing power of proteomics and metabolomics offers the potential of deeper understanding of blood function and storage and of better clinical products in the future. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Logistics outsourcing in the healthcare sector: Lessons from a Canadian experience,"Logistics activities are seen by many healthcare organizations as an opportunity for financial savings. The level of logistics complexity in these organizations may explain the challenges they face in applying solutions common in other industries. This case study of a medical-supply distribution outsourcing initiative to a logistics services provider by a group of hospitals in a region of Canada helps elucidate this complexity. The objective of this article is to identify the dissonances between various points of view in order to articulate lessons for managers while taking into account the specifics of the healthcare sector. By examining information from several sources, this study shows the necessity of: 1) setting objectives and managing expectations in order to maintain the interest and participation of stakeholders throughout the project; 2) updating internal logistics processes prior to outsourcing; 3) carefully considering a gradual transition phase by ensuring short-term benefits for both partners; 4) requiring problem-solving skills as a selection criterion for the logistics services provider to ensure continuous improvement in the performance of the outsourced activity; and 5) developing a governance accountability framework to support problem solving between all parties involved.

Drug inventory management and distribution: outsourcing logistics to thirdparty providers,"The purpose of the present research is to explore the current situation and future expectations on whether to selfmanage or outsource logistics operations in centralized healthcare networks, and to analyse and quantify the relationships between logistics outsourcing, costs and performance. The paper is based on a thorough study of a local Italian healthcare network, which evaluated the economic sustainability of logistics outsourcing. The data were collected using interviews, documentation and observations in hospital pharmacies and wards, and by referring to public information available on the internet. A system dynamic simulation followed by a sensitivity analysis was used to investigate the impact of changing key variables as well as the advice of logistics providers. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that logistics outsourcing is often the most economical choice. Performanceoriented concepts applied to healthcare have many pros in terms of sustainable delivery of quality healthcare at affordable costs. While there are numerous studies on logistics outsourcing in many industries, when it comes to the healthcare sector literature is scarce, probably due to the great changes this sector has faced in recent times: thus, the paper's quantitative findings should be seen as a first attempt to assist the “makeorbuy” decision process toward sustainable development of the healthcare sector. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Strategic Outsourcing: An International Journal,2013-02-15,10.1108/17538291311316063,0.6213033344383689
A Roadmap Towards Healthcare Logistics in Thailand,"Apart from operation dimension in supply chain, another perspective in healthcare supply chain is the infrastructure for Logistics. This infrastructure concerns much in data and information flows. The study focuses on three levels for constructing this infrastructures: Public health policy maker, provincial public health office and hospital levels. A survey was conducted. The framework for data collections was based on data standardization, database and its applications. The findings identified the status of such areas. It shows that lack of standardization could lead to poor information in the supply chain. Five core components for the foundation are recommended. These are standard data, standard exchange data, a single data pool, ability to track and trace and data centre. Implications and suggestions for policy makers are recommended.","2017 International Conference on Industrial Engineering, Management Science and Application, ICIMSA 2017",2017-07-19,10.1109/ICIMSA.2017.7985578,0.6042880356970517
Critical-to-life classification for managing inventory in a healthcare supply chain,"This paper presents a multi-criterion critical-to-life classification technique to supplement the cost and usage measures that are normally employed in hospital inventory management. A system dynamics model was developed employing (R, s, S) inventory control approach for a US private sector healthcare supply chain. Extensive simulation analyses were conducted to study the stock behaviour for low, medium and high usage critical-to-life items to maintain a range of service levels. The (R, s, S) design parameters were optimised according to the variability of item usage, the associated inventory level and supply lead-time. Our findings suggest that the proposed inventory classification technique allows for assigning a particular service level to each critical-to-life item to ensure its availability while minimising the cost and stock-out situations. The proposed simulation tool incorporating critical-to-life inventory classification facilitates hospital logistics managers to devise efficient inventory control strategies based on critical-to-life service level index.",International Journal of Intelligent Enterprise,2015-01-01,10.1504/IJIE.2015.073491,0.6001079686845223

A Decision Support Tool for the Location Routing Problem During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Colombia,"During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Bogotá, Colombia, some strategies for dealing with the increasing number of infected people and the level of occupation of intensive care units include the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). PPE is a crucial component for patient care and a priority for protecting healthcare workers. For attending this necessity, the location of distribution centers within the city and the corresponding routes to supply the intensive care units (ICU) with PPE have an important role. Formally, this problem is defined as the Location Routing Problem (LRP). The LRP is an NP-Hard problem that combines the Facility Location Problem (FLP) and the Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Depots (MDVRP). This work presents a decision support tool based on a simheuristic method that hybridize an Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm with Monte Carlo simulation to deal with the LRP with uncertain demands. Realistic data from Bogotá (Colombia) was retrieved using Google Maps to characterize the geographical distribution of both potential facilities and ICUs, while demands were generated using the uniform probability distribution. Our preliminary results suggest the competitiveness of the algorithm in both the deterministic and the stochastic versions of the LRP.",Communications in Computer and Information Science,2021-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-76310-7_3,0.5952478845363384

Automation in internal logistics: Strategic and operational challenges,"Automation in internal logistics is an enabler to increase overall competitiveness in an organisation. However, its use is currently limited. The main objective of this paper is to highlight the existing strategic and operational challenges to using and developing automation in internal logistics. A three-phased empirical study has been conducted, including case studies and a survey. The findings reveal a lack of responsibility for, and insight in current state of logistics operations as well as a lack of vision and strategy giving directions for desired future state of operations. In addition, the actual automation projects are hindered by poorly defined and supported processes.

Where to locate medical supplies in nursing units: An exploratory study,"Nursing unit inventory management is often cited as the top irritant that limits nurses’ ability to provide care at bedside. Our research focus is to determine whether the inventory location in the nursing units interferes with the performance of the replenishment system. The literature review suggests that a decentralization of nursing unit storage areas will require additional logistics resources to manage all of these storage points. Our case studies of four Canadian hospitals tend to demonstrate that decentralized locations do not necessarily lead to a decrease in productivity for logistics staff. Furthermore, although our research focuses on the inventory location in nursing units, it is difficult to isolate the impact of this aspect in the context of the entire replenishment system. For example, reorder frequency also has an impact on productivity. Further research could focus on these topics.",Supply Chain Forum,2018-01-01,10.1080/16258312.2018.1433438,0.5667809262773325
A novel group ownership transfer protocol for RFID systems,"Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a wireless communication technology nowadays widely used in almost every aspect of our lives including healthcare, logistics and supply chain management, inventory tracking, race timing, access control, toll collection, and a lot more. In RFID systems, a tag usually stores private or sensitive information, and so it needs an access control mechanism. When a tag's owner is changed, the read permission of the tag needs to be transferred from the old owner to the new owner, and this is when ownership transfer schemes come into play. In fact, not only do RFID ownership transfer schemes do ownership transfer, but they have to make sure that the ownership transfer procedure is executed under proper security protection. Besides, in some particular environments, the ownership transfer would be far more efficiently done if the tags could be treated as a group instead of individual tags. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel group ownership transfer protocol that satisfies all important security requirements including mutual authentication, data and location privacy, forward/backward secrecy, ownership privacy, and group ownership integrity. In addition, due to the use of cloud computing, our new protocol provides ubiquitous authentication. Based on homomorphic encryption and quadratic residues, our novel RFID group ownership transfer protocol can have encrypted data efficiently processed, and the communication cost is very low. The results of our BAN logic correctness check, security analysis, and performance evaluation confirm that the new protocol is logically correct and is capable of providing high level security/privacy protection on the basis of high cost-effective performance.",Ad Hoc Networks,2019-08-01,10.1016/j.adhoc.2019.101873,0.5574486041186639

Logistics chain optimization and scheduling of hospital pharmacy drugs using genetic algorithms: Morocco case,"In recent years, the health sector has faced increasingly important challenges. Due to the economic crisis and competitions, hospitals are facing many issues affecting the supply chain, such as budget cuts or lack thereof as well as insufficient human resources. Although essential for an excellent service, logistics take up a considerable part of the budget as challenges need to be addressed such as delays in drugs delivery, transportation and storage conditions, routing and scheduling. As to governance, each hospital is assigned to a specific region, which cannot be defined due to political, demographic, or geographic issues. This paper focuses on multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP) in healthcare logistics to feed the hospital pharmacies. The idea is to apply MDVRP’s approach to the health sector, specifically hospital pharmacies. In this projection, hospitals are considered to present clients, and central pharmacies present deposits. This problem (the MDVRP) is known by this nature NP-hard. For that, the heuristic method was used as genetic algorithm to solve the problem. The paper is organized as follows, the first section discusses, compares, and proposes clustering methods for healthcare facilities with applying them on Moroccan hospitals case; the second section proposes a genetic algorithm to resolve the MDVRP with a simulation.",International Journal of Web-Based Learning and Teaching Technologies,2021-03-01,10.4018/IJWLTT.2021030104,0.5310481321866607
Artificial Intelligence for Smart Cities: Locational Planning and Dynamic Routing of Emergency Vehicles,"To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of essential emergency services such as ambulances, fire brigades, and police, one of the most important problems to tackle is to minimize the response times of these emergency vehicles. As well as attaining optimal waiting sites and deployment strategies for the emergency vehicles, the optimal routing and traffic preemption of the vehicles are also crucial in minimizing response times and maximizing coverage. As locational planning and dynamic routing of the emergency vehicles relate to many different situations with varying emergency levels, they are a crucial part of the smart city concept.

Mobile healthcare service planning in rural areas: A hybrid record to record travel algorithm,"Due to the economic infeasibility of establishing comprehensive healthcare facilities in sparsely populated areas and the responsibility of governments to ensure equal healthcare access for citizens, different approaches have been sought in healthcare service delivery. The Republic of Turkiye's Ministry of Health provides mobile healthcare services (MHS) to 9 million people monthly through 3400 healthcare facilities and 7500 doctors. This study focuses on the Mobile Healthcare Service Routing and Scheduling Problem (MHS-RSP). The objective of MHS-RSP is to determine the daily routes of doctors on a monthly basis to minimize total distance traveled, taking into account constraints such as working hours, route time, minimum service time per visit, and dedicated doctor assignments to villages. A mixed-integer mathematical model is developed to address the problem, which is NP-hard and equivalent to the multi-depot time-constrained periodic vehicle routing problem. To solve medium- and large-sized problems efficiently, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm named ""GCH-RRT"" is introduced, based on greedy constructive heuristic(GCH) and record-to-record travel(RRT) metaheuristic.

This can encompass a range of services, from telemedicine consultations to home-delivered medication, or even advanced medical procedures conducted at home.",Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Packing Sourcer,2024-01-01,,0.4916306629956336
Investigating automation and AGV in healthcare logistics: a case study based approach,"In France, as in numerous countries, healthcare organisations are undergoing major transformations, leading them to rationalise their resources and optimize their flows. In this context, automation can play an important role, enabling value creation and patient satisfaction. Previous research has mainly focused on the technological aspects of automation, neglecting the organisational issues related to the implementation of this innovation and particularly the management of the hospital staff, including logistics personnel, involved within the organisational change process. The aim of this article is, at least, to partly address this gap within the literature, and to propose, based on an exploratory case study, an analysis grid of the challenges and changes in terms of logistics flows (pharmaceutical, waste, laundry, etc.) that impact staff involved in managing these flows in a hospital context. Our results highlight the importance and necessity of anticipating the building and deployment of new knowledge and skills in order to efficiently and effectively design and manage automated logistics flows with AGV system.",International Journal of Logistics Research and Applications,2019-05-04,10.1080/13675567.2018.1518414,0.4892397809952144
Modelling hospital materials management processes,"Materials management is an important issue for healthcare systems because it influences clinical and financial outcomes. Before selecting, adapting and implementing leading or optimized practices, a good understanding of processes and activities has to be developed. In real applications, the information flows and business strategies involved are different from hospital to hospital, depending on context, culture and available resources; it is therefore difficult to find a comprehensive and exhaustive description of processes, even more so a clear formalization of them. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, it proposes an integrated and detailed analysis and description model for hospital materials management data and tasks, which is able to tackle information from patient requirements to usage, from replenishment requests to supplying and handling activities. The model takes account of medical risk reduction, traceability and streamlined processes perspectives. Second, the paper translates this information into a business process model and mathematical formalization. The study provides a useful guide to the various relevant technology-related, management and business issues, laying the foundations of an efficient reengineering of the supply chain to reduce healthcare costs and improve the quality of care. © 2013 Iannoneet al.",International Journal of Engineering Business Management,2013-01-01,10.5772/56607,0.4846186178105154
An iterated local search for the biomedical sample transportation problem with multiple and interdependent pickups,"This article addresses a new version of the biomedical sample transportation problem, as a vehicle routing problem with precedence constraints arising in the context of healthcare logistics, and proposes an iterated local search algorithm to solve it. This new version is more realistic and complex since it considers the collection centres’ opening hours and the moment at which they are visited as decision variables, granting additional flexibility to elaborate more efficient routes. Indeed, this problem is harder to model and to solve than its previous version because the constraint on the short samples’ lifetime leads to interdependency between successive pickups at each collection center. A metaheuristic is thus proposed to solve real-life instances. Numerical experiments confirm (1) the value of simultaneously planning routes, opening hours, and visit hours (which is new in the literature) and (2) the efficiency of the proposed algorithm to solve this problem.",Journal of the Operational Research Society,2021-01-01,10.1080/01605682.2019.1657369,0.4827182949573966
Divide and Conquer: A Location-Allocation Approach to Sectorization,"Sectorization is concerned with dividing a large territory into smaller areas, also known as sectors. This process usually simplifies a complex problem, leading to easier solution approaches to solving the resulting subproblems. Sectors are built with several criteria in mind, such as equilibrium, compactness, contiguity, and desirability, which vary with the applications. Sectorization appears in different contexts: sales territory design, political districting, healthcare logistics, and vehicle routing problems (agrifood distribution, winter road maintenance, parcel delivery). Environmental problems can also be tackled with a sectorization approach; for example, in municipal waste collection, water distribution networks, and even in finding more sustainable transportation routes. This work focuses on sectorization concerning the location of the area’s centers and allocating basic units to each sector. Integer programming models address the location-allocation problems, and various formulations implementing different criteria are compared. Methods to deal with multiobjective optimization problems, such as the (Formula presented.) -constraint, the lexicographic, and the weighted sum methods, are applied and compared. Computational results obtained for a set of benchmarking instances of sectorization problems are also presented.",Mathematics,2023-06-01,10.3390/math11112553,0.4783190424462001
Performance indicator selection for operating room supply chains: An application of ANP,"Manufacturing and maintenance processes significantly benefit from effective and integrated Supply Chain Management (SCM). Recently, hospitals start to recognize the importance of these logistics initiatives to improve their operational performance while also maintaining high quality of patient care. Patient care processes are supported by a range of supply chain activities including inventory management and distribution of medical supplies to point-of-care locations. At the operating room for instance, the logistics staff's goal is managing materials and information flows to have the requested materials at the right operating room at the right time, in the most efficient way. However, poor inventory management, lack of standardization and lack of coordination between departments complicate healthcare logistics processes, and hence result in many waste. Opportunities for efficiency gains in these logistics processes can be identified by measuring the performance of the internal supply chain. This paper presents a rigorously defined logistics performance measurement framework to evaluate the efficiency of logistics processes in operating rooms. The Analytic Network Process (ANP) is utilized as a popular Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique to provide effective decision-support models. The proposed ANP-based framework is a first step towards measuring the performance of operating room supply chain processes by selecting and prioritizing logistics objectives and associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Further research is required to validate the ANP framework by including multiple stakeholders’ preferences, as they may have conflicting views on performance definitions. The final goal of the framework is to support hospital logistics managers in making transparent and informed decisions to improve inventory and distribution policies in the operating room while considering all stakeholders’ preferences.",Operations Research for Health Care,2019-12-01,10.1016/j.orhc.2019.100229,0.4696468525499782

Service modularity in managing healthcare logistics,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how modularity is used for enabling value creation in managing healthcare logistics services. Design/methodology/approach: Material logistics of four different kinds of hospitals is examined through a qualitative case study. The theoretical framework builds on the literature on healthcare logistics, service modularity and value creation. Findings: The case hospitals have developed their material logistics independently from others when looking at the modularity of offerings, processes and organisations. Services, such as assortment management, shelving and developing an information platform, have been performed in-house partly by the care personnel, but steps towards modularised and standardised solutions are now being taken in the case hospitals, including ideas about outsourcing some of the services. Research limitations/implications: This paper proposes seven modularity components for healthcare logistics management: segmentation, categorisation and unitisation of offerings, differentiation and decoupling of processes, and centralisation and specialisation of organisations. Thus, this study clarifies the three-dimensional concept of modularity as a cognitive frame for managing logistics services with heterogeneous customer needs in a rapidly changing healthcare environment. Practical implications: Modularity offers a tool for developing logistics services inside the hospital and increases possibilities to consider also external logistics service providers. Social implications: Managing healthcare logistics services through modularity has potential social implications in developing healthcare processes and changing the usage of health services. On a wider scale, modularity is helping healthcare systems reaching their goals in terms of service quality and cost. Originality/value: This paper shows the context-specific antecedents of service modularity and the usage of modular thinking in managing healthcare logistics.",International Journal of Logistics Management,2019-02-12,10.1108/IJLM-12-2017-0338,0.46272216711065656
Intellectual property issues in artificial intelligence: Specific reference to the service sector,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed almost every field of the service sector, such as finance, healthcare logistics, automotive and aviation. The innovative technologies can identify uneven patterns like spam filtering or payment deceit, and make aware businesses in actual time about questionable activities, hence are helpful in the growth of a market. These innovation and creation are protected under different forms of intellectual property (IP). However, the transformation from AI related inventions to AI lead inventions has raised substantial challenges to the existing IP infrastructure. This study aims at looking into different aspects of AI related IP protection with an elaborative analysis of the patenting trends through landscape analysis of AI in the service sector.

Overall user satisfaction with family planning services and associated quality care factors: A cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Studies of user satisfaction with family planning services (FPSs) have been conducted in different countries, and have been employed to identify ways of improving health, reducing costs and implementing reforms. The present work is the first-ever study undertaken in Mexico on the subject. Our objective was to identify how overall user satisfaction with FPSs in Mexico was related to: healthcare logistics, the functional value of services and the quality of interpersonal relations. Methods: Users of 18 public clinics were surveyed in 2015. Data collected referred to their past and present use of FPSs, as well as to their perceptions of the services provided. We built a logistic regression model with potentially influential variables in order to assess their association with overall satisfaction. Results: According to the self-reports of the 722 users interviewed, the following factors were decisive in their overall satisfaction with services: receiving sufficient information during visits (OR = 3.38; 95% CI:1.88-6.06), feeling that their opinions were taken into consideration by clinic staff (OR = 2.58; 95% CI:1.14-5.85), feeling that the motives for their visits were addressed (OR = 2.71; 95% CI:1.29-5.71), being assigned enough time for consultation (OR = 2.35; 95% CI:1.26-4.37), having the opportunity to ask questions and clarify doubts (OR = 2.31; 95% CI:1.21-4.43), experiencing no or few interruptions during their medical consultations (OR = 1.97;95% CI:1.10-3.51), and feeling satisfied with the contraceptive method provided (OR = 1.79; 95% CI:1.03-3.11). Conclusions: Service providers must be kept well informed on the perspective of users concerning user expectations. Taking into account the cultural context and perceived needs of users while providing service would improve the quality of care and, hence, the overall satisfaction of users.",Reproductive Health,2018-10-12,10.1186/s12978-018-0615-3,0.45042943340204156
On people and complexity in healthcare service supply,"Healthcare logistics is treated as a fundamentally emergent complex system primarily because a broad range of stakeholders are included.

Efficient estimation of a risk measure requiring two-stage simulation optimization,"This paper is concerned with the efficient estimation of the risk measure of a system where the estimation requires solving a two-stage simulation optimization problem. The first stage samples risk factors that specify a second stage simulation optimization problem. The second stage solves a simulation optimization problem and outputs the best performance of the system under the realized risk factors, which are then aggregated across all first stage samples to produce an estimate of the risk measure. Applications of such an estimation scheme arise frequently in important industries such as financial, healthcare, logistics, and manufacturing. Because a large number of first stage samples are typically needed, each of which requires solving a computationally expensive simulation optimization problem, the two-stage simulation optimization approach faces a major computational efficiency challenge. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes a sequential simulation budget allocation procedure that determines the allocation of simulation budget based on a score known as revised probability of sign change for each decision under each scenario. The consistency of the proposed procedure is proved and the computational efficiency gain of the proposed is demonstrated using both benchmark test functions and two test cases in the context of financial portfolio risk estimation and healthcare system resilience estimation.",European Journal of Operational Research,2023-03-16,10.1016/j.ejor.2022.06.028,0.4457975577626792
Reorganisation of the internal storage and distribution logistics in a hospital,"This study involved the analysis and improvement of the internal distribution and storage at Hospital da Senhora da Oliveira - Guimaraes, a 500-beds general hospital in the north of Portugal. The study evolved around an action-research strategy that comprised five sequential and interconnected phases. Initially, the internal supply chain of the hospital was analysed with a special focus on ward warehouses (WW) and data about the logistics processes of the WW were gathered. Following, a prototype WW to test a set of innovative solutions aimed at dealing with the difficulties identified in the previous phase was developed. The proposed improvements were analysed and then implemented in the WW of a health care department, which lead to a new data collection about the performance of the logistics processes. The implementation of the proposed solutions resulted in a reduction of the time spent collecting, debiting and storing materials of 55% to 66%. It was also possible to reduce the error rate in these processes by 93%. When the proposed solutions are expanded to the whole hospital, in a year, it will be possible to save 4,819 hours in WW logistics processes (that can be dedicated to provide care to patients) and to avoid 115,843 errors",Procedia Computer Science,2023-01-01,10.1016/j.procs.2023.01.421,0.44334573761934826
Navigating uncertain distribution problem: a new approach for resolution optimization of transportation with several objectives under uncertainty,"Amidst uncertainty, decision-making in manufacturing becomes a central focus due to its complexity. This study explores complex transportation constraints and uses novel ways to guide manufacturers. The Multi-objective Stochastic Linear Fractional Transportation Problem (MOSLFTP) is a crucial tool for managing supply chains, manufacturing operations, energy distribution, emergency routes, healthcare logistics, and other related areas. It adeptly addresses uncertainty, transforming efficiency and effectiveness in several domains. Stochastic programming is the process of converting theoretical probabilities into concrete certainties. The artistic compromise programming technique acts as a proficient mediator, reconciling opposing objectives and enabling equitable decision-making. This novel approach also addresses the Multi-objective Stochastic Linear plus Linear Fractional Transportation Problem (MOSLPLFTP), which involves two interconnected issues. The effectiveness of these principles is clearly shown with the help of the LINGO® 18 optimization solver.

Patient journey modeling using integrated data structures in healthcare service operations,"Improving patient flow and patient satisfaction have attracted considerable interest in recent years. Recognizing the need for taking a holistic approach to improving healthcare service operations, this paper presents an integrated framework for patient journey modeling from admission through to discharge. The proposed framework enhances the capability of service delivery systems to cope with the uncertainty associated with planning and scheduling of healthcare service operations towards achieving the desired patient flow and satisfaction levels. The patient journey model developed based on the unitary structuring technique is illustrated using a selected healthcare scenario, identifying the patient flow with process and data elements, as well as information flows. It is shown that integration of processes, data elements, information flows and relationships enables modeling of patient journey for improving patient flow and satisfaction through effective and efficient planning of healthcare logistics.

Data standards in healthcare supply chain operations,"This paper presents the challenges and benefits associated with adoption of healthcare supply chain data standards in a hospital environment. In a highly fragmented industry like healthcare with several stakeholders, the adoption and use of common data standards for identifying delivery locations and products is critical. Common data standards ensure system wide interoperability and visibility across the supply chain, contributing to improvements in patient safety and streamlined internal and external supply chain operations. However, the global healthcare industry has been significantly slow in adopting data standards in comparison to other industries like retail, manufacturing. We discuss the results from data standard adoption pilot project conducted by Center for Innovation in Healthcare Logistics (CIHL), University of Arkansas at Washington Regional Medical Center, a 325 bed not-for-profit hospital in Fayet-teville, Arkansas. CIHL data standards pilot involved studying the existing supply chain processes, design, pilot-test, and evaluation of GS1 data standards adoption over a sample of products and a single delivery location at the hospital.

The Dial-a-Ride Problem with School Bell Time Adjustment,"In this paper, we study a paratransit application in which children are transported every day from their homes to their special schools or medical-social establishments. To optimize this transportation system, the establishments collaborate to propose a joint transportation plan. We propose a new algorithm to jointly build vehicle routes that visit several establishments and simultaneously set the establishments’ opening hours. This algorithm combines a large neighborhood search, the resolution of a route-based model, and the progressive shrinkage of the planning window. It is applied to a real case from the area of Lyon in France, including 34 schools and 575 heterogeneous users served by a heterogeneous fleet of reconfigurable vehicles. On average, we show that in addition to the 10% of saving that can be expected by sharing vehicle routes between schools, 7% of additional savings can be achieved by school bell adjustment. This cost saving also decreases average user ride times and the number of vehicles required, creating longer routes that are more attractive for driver services.",Transportation Science,2023-01-01,10.1287/trsc.2022.1160,0.3717468737489879
Measuring process performance within healthcare logistics - a decision tool for selecting track and trace technologies,"Monitoring tasks and ascertaining quality of work is difficult in a logistical healthcare process due to cleaning personnel being dispersed throughout the hospital. Performance measurement can support the organization in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of processes and in ensuring quality of work.

Progress towards data standards adoption in healthcare,"The contribution of this paper is to report on the progress of and barriers to adoption of data standards in healthcare logistics. This paper is directed to engineering managers with an interest in healthcare management, information management, and supply chain management. Data standards in healthcare logistics fall into two categories: product identification numbers and location identification numbers. Product identification numbers are assigned to any item that may be priced, ordered, or invoiced at any point in any supply chain, location identification numbers are used to identify physical locations to improve the efficiency of communication with the supply chain. The main objective of this paper is to convey the potential benefits of data standards adoption in the healthcare supply chain and present empirical evidence of progress toward adoption as well as a discussion of barriers toward adoption. Data is presented and analyzed from surveys conducted in 2008, 2010 and 2011. The results show encouraging progress being made towards data standards adoption; however, many barriers still exist. Engineering managers will appreciate the potential benefits of data standards adoption in healthcare logistics and will see the role engineers and engineering managers can have in facilitating data standards adoption and overcoming the barriers faced. Engineering managers will also see the opportunities for healthcare process improvement once data standards are adopted.

Unlocking Solver Potential: A Framework for Analysis and Inter-Comparison of Optimisation Solvers,"Linear and mixed integer optimisation problems have demonstrated their strength in the field of (healthcare) logistics and supply chain management for years. However, real-world optimisation problems are complex in nature, and various mathematical programming solvers are leveraged to solve these problems today. With several advances in solver technologies in recent years, there has been growing interest in carrying out comparative evaluations of solvers for a range of applications. However, there appears a lack of guidance for decision makers to conduct solver performance assessment and inter-comparison. To address this gap, we aim to derive a framework of parameters deemed most relevant for evaluating and comparing different solvers for a given application.

From patients' needs to hospital pharmacy management: An holistic approach to the process modelling,"Materials management is a great issue for healthcare systems because it influences performances of structures in terms of clinical and financial outcomes. Enhancements can be done by means of an appropriate management of data related to these materials coming from all processes in which they are involved. This paper presents an integrated and detailed description and model of the hospital materials management process, able to tackle information from patient requirements to materials usage, according to traceability and streamlined processes perspectives. The holistic approach adopted, based on hospital cases analysis, literature review and international guidelines, tends to look at all actors, materials and processes involved, with the attempt to provide academicals and practitioners with a useful guide to the various technology-related, management and business issues that can arise during the design or reengineering of this business process and the associated information system.","1st International Workshop on Innovative Simulation for Health Care, IWISH 2012, Held at the International Multidisciplinary Modeling and Simulation Multiconference, I3M 2012",2012-01-01,,0.2920642563891242
Healthcare logistics: A comparative study in 12 hospitals,"Hospitals are characterized by, its complexity, the simultaneous presence of two distribution chains: the external and the internal. The external supply chain includes the multitude of different supplies and the distribution channels through which they flow. For the internal supply chain to the patient care units, hospitals must deploy their own distribution network. According to several studies, it is estimated that 46% of a hospital's total operating budget is spent on logistics related activities. Nursing staff will spend on average 10% of their time on logistic tasks. Due to the diversity of the healthcare materials management in hospitals, distributors were offering, instead of the conventional replenishment method, a stockless replenishment method, whereby the distributor picks and packs products, according to the needs of each patient care unit, and delivers them directly. The practices identified for the internal supply chain management systems are 1) on view, 2) par level systems or 3) the implementation of double container replenishment systems also called two bin or empty-full. The study shows that the hospitals of the survey have made supply chain integration efforts. The author first describes some theoretical concepts based on literature, the results of the empirical study in 12 Flemish hospitals is then explained. It examines the internal and external supply chain of healthcare materials management of three materials 1) linen, 2) materials of the central store and 3) sterile medical supplies.

Benchmarking healthcare logistics processes–a comparative case study of Danish and US hospitals,"Logistics processes in hospitals are vital in the provision of patient care. Improving healthcare logistics processes provides an opportunity for reduced healthcare costs and better support of clinical processes. Hospitals are faced with increasing healthcare costs around the world and improvement initiatives prevalent in manufacturing industries such as lean, business process reengineering and benchmarking have seen an increase in use in healthcare. This study investigates how logistics processes in a hospital can be benchmarked to improve process performance. A comparative case study of the bed logistics process and the pharmaceutical distribution process was conducted at a Danish and a US hospital. The case study results identified decision criteria for designing efficient and effective healthcare logistics processes. The most important decision criteria were related to quality, security of supply and employee engagement. Based on these decision criteria, performance indicators were developed to enable benchmarking of logistics processes in healthcare. The study contributes to the limited literature on healthcare logistics benchmarking.

Healthcare logistics in disaster planning and emergency management: A perspective,"This paper discusses the role of healthcare supply chain management in disaster mitigation and management. While there is an abundance of literature examining emergency management and disaster preparedness efforts across an array of industries, little information has been directed specifically toward the emergency interface, interoperability and unconventional relationships among civilian institutions and the US Department of Defense (US DoD) or supply chain operations involved therein. To address this imbalance, this paper provides US DoD healthcare supply chain managers with concepts related to communicating and planning more effectively. It is worth remembering, however, that all disasters are local - under the auspice of tiered response involving federal agencies, the principal responsibility for responding to domestic disasters and emergencies rests with the lowest level of government equipped and able to deal with the incident effectively. As such, the findings are equally applicable to institutions outside the military. It also bears repeating that every crisis is unique: there is no such thing as a uniform response for every incident. The role of the US DoD in emergency preparedness and disaster planning is changing and will continue to do so as the need for roles in support of a larger effort also continues to change.",Journal of business continuity &amp; emergency planning,2017-12-01,,0.2695255228620462

Using lean manufacturing and machine learning for improving medicines procurement and dispatching in a hospital,"Industry 4.0 concepts are defined around the use of new technologies for improving industrial companies according to scientific, technological and organizational aspects. Enterprise complex problems could be solved in this frame. Many methods and concepts presented in the literature are focused on these aspects. A new method is being developed in Icam Paris-Sénart around the idea that sustainability must be the kernel of “industry of the future”. Indeed, the framework proposed is a combination of the previous aspects with environmental, social and societal aspects. The actual situation of the planet is an encouragement to make all future transformations with sustainability as kernel. These concepts could be imported in healthcare logistics and transport area for solving specific problems of this domain. Icam (French Engineer school) and FEI University are collaborating for proposing to healthcare hospitals a new framework (healthcare logistics 4.0) for solving complex problems of this domain. This paper is focusing on how to improve medicines procurement and dispatching in a hospital. Indeed, the use of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare sector is growing up. Data treated and analyzed could give important insights for solving problems and improving the existing organization. As machine learning is already exploited in many production management problems (forecasting, storage, production, etc.), the idea is to use it for developing an aided tool in addition to a lean manufacturing classical approach. After presenting the real problem of medicines procurement and dispatching detected in healthcare hospitals, concepts of lean manufacturing and machine learning will be exposed. Then, the methodology proposed for solving the problem will be shown. An illustration will be given for validating concepts presented.

Cooperative Blood Inventory Ledger (CoBIL): A decentralized decision-making framework for improving blood product management,"Inefficiencies in blood product management systems, including segmented operations, lack of detailed data sharing, and limited real-time visibility, can often result in significant annual losses in product wastage and postponed medical procedures. Left unaddressed, the negative impact on patient health and healthcare systems can be substantial as blood donations continue to decline. This paper proposes the Cooperative Blood Inventory Ledger (CoBIL), a blockchain and smart-contract enabled system designed to mitigate some of these inefficiencies by increasing cooperation among all echelons of the blood supply chain, without sacrificing entity privacy and competition. The proposed framework facilitates collaborative decision-making among all stakeholders to distribute blood products across healthcare networks and reduce system costs. It also facilitates product redistribution among hospitals and other transfusion points to reduce losses due to expired product or canceled medical procedures due to product shortages. A role-based smart contract is included in the framework to define stakeholder access and manage data exchange. To analyze the feasibility of the proposed framework, we implement a proof of concept on a local machine using Hyperledger fabric's test network and employ it to simulate transactions required for the inventory operations of a regional blood supply chain.",Computers and Industrial Engineering,2022-10-01,10.1016/j.cie.2022.108571,0.24037039134423152
Improved renal cancer prognosis among users of drugs targeting renin-angiotensin system,"Purpose: We explored renal cell cancer (RCC) survival among users of antihypertensive medication as hypertension is proposed to be a risk factor for RCC and ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been associated with improved prognosis of RCC. Methods: Finnish cohort of 13,873 participants with RCC diagnosed between 1995–2012 was formed from three national databases. RCC cases were identified from Finnish Cancer Registry, medication usage from national prescription database and co-morbidities from Care Registry of Healthcare. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for metastatic tumor extent at the time of diagnosis. Risk of RCC specific death after diagnosis was analyzed using Cox regression adjusted for tumor clinical characteristics. Results: A total of 5,179 participants died of RCC during the follow-up. No risk association was found for metastatic tumor extent for any drug group. ACE-inhibitors, but no other drug group were associated with decreased risk of RCC specific death overall (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82–0.95) compared to non-users. In time-dependent analysis high-dose use of ACE-inhibitors (392 Defined Daily Dose (DDD)/year), HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.45–0.66) and ARBs (786.1 DDD/year, HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50–0.87) associated with improved RCC survival. No information of TNM-classification or tobacco smoking was available. Conclusion: ACE-inhibitors and ARBs in high dose associated with improved RCC specific survival. This may reflect overall benefit of treating hypertension with medication targeting renin-angiotensin system (RAS) system among RCC patients.

Hybridizing a matheuristic with ALNS for the optimal collection and delivery of medical specimens,"The past few years of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak have shown that optimal management of medical specimens is a key aspect of healthcare logistics, both for addressing the delivery of perishable items such as vaccines, and for ensuring the timely analysis of swabs and samples. Accordingly, recent optimization literature described the problem of optimal collection and delivery of medical specimens, modeled as a multitrip vehicle routing problem with time windows and a completion time objective function. Aiming to achieve good-quality solutions in short computational times, this work describes a hybrid approach, combining a matheuristic construction phase with an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS). Our matheuristic relies on a clustering algorithm to yield subsets of the medical specimens that are optimally served by single vehicles of the fleet. The solutions of the matheuristic phase serve as starting points for the ALNS intensification phase. Extensive experimentation on both new and established benchmark problem instances shows that our hybrid method is able to match the optimality of the state of the art on small instances and outperforms the existing exact method by one order of magnitude on larger problems.",International Transactions in Operational Research,2023-01-01,10.1111/itor.13386,0.221055856558235

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Adaptation to Facilitate Healthcare Supply Chains in Low-Income Countries,"Low-income countries are persistently suffering from last-mile logistics issues in healthcare supply chains. Therefore, it is high time to explore technological applications to overcome such inadequacies. The faster speed, low maintenance cost, and absence of road dependency in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have popularized them as an alternative to road delivery. Hence, it is suggested as a solution to overcome the persisting distribution inefficiencies in healthcare logistics of low-income countries. According to the case study analysis conducted on the Sri Lankan vaccine cold chain, incorporating UAVs increases truck-space utilization and reduces the time consumed, cost incurred, and carbon dioxide emission in a delivery round. Moreover, the most suitable way to cover the initial setup cost of an unmanned aerial system (UAS) is by receiving aid from international donors. The capital cost also can be covered by government investments or via service outsourcing only if the number of flights per year is increased. Moreover, a homogenous (i.e., only UAV) solution was revealed to be more beneficial than a heterogeneous (i.e., truck and UAV) solution. However, due to the lack of technology literacy and willingness to change in low-income countries, it is recommended to initially execute a heterogeneous solution and expand to a homogeneous plan in the future years. However, it was evident that for a mixed-fleet solution to be advantageous, drone characteristics play a vital role. Hence, a UAV with specifications ideal for the use case must be utilized to garner the maximum benefits. Nevertheless, it was apparent that with the right implementation plan, UAVs possess the potential to overcome the shortcomings in the healthcare logistics of low-income countries.",Drones,2022-11-01,10.3390/drones6110321,0.1893503887601424
How to use lean manufacturing for improving a Healthcare logistics performance,"Most companies in the world are focused on their global performance for being competitive on the market. Lean manufacturing is one of the main methodologies used by them for increasing their supply chain and logistics performance. Indeed, Logistics performance improvement implies the definition of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for measuring at each transformation level, the evolution of the logistics system. Thus, Industry 4.0 and logistics 4.0 concepts are defined for implementing new technologies, tools and organizations in companies in order to define their future. A new framework, based on lean manufacturing and DMAIC methodologies, with sustainability as its kernel has been developed in Icam, A Higher education school, for SMEs. In addition, European population is growing older day by day and they are regularly visiting hospitals. In this context, the treatment of patients in good conditions (quality, cost and lead time) is necessary as much as the hospital global performance.

The influence of supply chain immunity perceptions on COVID-19 vaccine willingness in supply chain professionals,"Purpose: This study examines the lack of confidence in the actions of the government and pharmaceutical companies during vaccine deployment. The authors introduce the concept of supply chain immunity. The authors test whether the perception of higher vaccine supply chain immunity leads to higher willingness to be vaccinated within the supply chain community. Design/methodology/approach: The authors utilize factor analysis and item response theory methods to develop a scale for measuring supply chain immunity. The original and psychometrically sound scale is tested via a structural equation model (SEM). Factor analysis and SEM use survey responses from two samples of 125 supply chain executives. Findings: SEM suggests that supply chain immunity perceptions are a strong predictor of overall supply chain confidence for COVID vaccines. Further, these perceptions, through supply chain confidence, indirectly impact individuals' self-reported willingness to personally accept a vaccine themselves.

Optimal Multikey Homomorphic Encryption with Steganography Approach for Multimedia Security in Internet of Everything Environment,"Recent developments of semiconductor and communication technologies have resulted in the interconnection of numerous devices in offering seamless communication and services, which is termed as Internet of Everything (IoE). It is a subset of Internet of Things (IoT) which finds helpful in several applications namely smart city, smart home, precise agriculture, healthcare, logistics, etc. Despite the benefits of IoE, it is limited to processing and storage abilities, resulting in the degrada-tion of device safety, privacy, and efficiency. Security and privacy become major concerns in the transmission of multimedia data over the IoE network. Encryption and image steganography is considered effective solutions to accomplish secure data transmission in the IoE environment. For resolving the limitations of the existing works, this article proposes an optimal multikey homomorphic encryption with steganography approach for multimedia security (OMKHES‐MS) technique in the IoE environment. Primarily, singular value decomposition (SVD) model is applied for the separation of cover images into RGB elements. Besides, optimum pixel selection process is carried out using coyote optimization algorithm (COA). At the same time, the encryption of secret images is performed using poor and rich optimization (PRO) with multikey homomorphic encryption (MKHE) technique. Finally, the cipher image is embedded into the chosen pixel values of the cover image to generate stego image. For assessing the better outcomes of the OMKHES‐MS model, a wide range of experiments were carried out.

However, positioning precision is restricted by various hindrances within the mise-en-scène, especially the Non-Line-Of-Sight context which affects signal dispersion and occlusions. The proliferation of numerous RF technologies, such as RFID, WiFi, Bluetooth or Zigbee, etc. facilitates users to detect an object’s location within a peculiar range. Consequently, in the scope of this paper, a short-range technology system is developed for indoor positioning. The system is exploited properly to trail an object equipped with a small tag using Ultra-Wide Band module as ESP32. For the exact localization of the matter, the method measures the running time of wave between the object and at least two receivers (called bilateration). Also, the model is validated through a good accordant comparison between simulation and experimental results.",Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies,2023-01-01,10.1007/978-3-031-46573-4_35,0.15697822294647865

Technological implementation in the service sector: A case study,"The service industry is a crucial industry recognized as the biggest of the three sectors of the economy. Implementing technology in this industry has been the driving force for industrial advancement. In contrast, this industry's disproportionate adoption of technology explains the disparity between developing and developed worlds. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been recognized as the newest technology disrupting and driving innovation in the service industry, with the quest for superior business experience and customer service driving its adoption. However, AI is not the only technology driving transformations in the service industry but also a constituent of innovative technologies, such as search, chatbots, cloud computing, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), mobile, social, and the IoT. In addition, this chapter advocates for the fourth component of cloud computing to be named diversity as a service (DaaS). Technology is the most significant enabler of globalization. Globalization is the most fantastic driver of diversities-creating opportunities, virtual, and physical, for people from different cultural, religious, racial, geographical, and other backgrounds to interact. However, this confluence of diversities is leading to unsavory human experiences giving rise to racial protests, gender inequalities, underrepresentation of ethnic minorities, and others. However, implementing technology in diversity management could be the elixir to these problems. The chapter seeks to explore the implications of technology implementation in the service industry to ascertain whether the economic impact of technology in the service industry influences its adoption and how to encourage technology adoption in the service industry. The chapter also analyzes whether technology implementation in the service sector is economical to provide organizations with a decision-making tool for further exploring the industry and making experimental projections of technology's prognosis in the service industry to encourage research and scientific activity. This is because many or most of the literature on AI are projections, simulations, and assumptions emphasizing how the implementation of AI will increase unemployment and change the labor landscape in ways that may not be familiar to many. We adapted the core generalizations from some of these reports to evaluate these projections. Academic and research reports from the sciences, engineering, and medicine on information technology (IT) and the U.S. workforce into an analytical framework because it embodies the core assumptions of most of the literature on the subject. We then used the analytical framework to analyze secondary data from those who have implemented these technologies to see whether the implementation of technology in the service sector was economical or not and whether economic factors affected the adoption of the technology. Finally, we explored possible extensions of existing knowledge as experimental projections to encourage further research. Furthermore, the chapter explored three critical sectors of the service industry as case studies, including the Healthcare, Logistics, and Entertainment sectors, and attempted an economic analysis of the implementation of technology in these sectors and projected experimental investigation of the consequences of implementing technology in these sectors in the future. It was noticed that the implementation of technology in the service industry is gaining increased adoption with signs of growing adoption into the future. Economically, the performance of technology increases productivity, lowers costs, and transforms the way work is done and changes the labor landscape, with machines gaining greater involvement and acceptance as co-workers with human counterparts. This shows the economic benefits of implementing technology in the service sector in increasing its adoption. Most importantly, it was established that different levels of education, not technology, are the causes of income inequalities. Generally, the implementation of technology increases the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery in these sectors, leading to labor efficiency, increased productivity, and cost-effectiveness. Experimentally, the chapter projects that we are entering the era of flying cargoes and rocket-like cargo ships. The chapter concludes with claims that though machines will see greater adoption in the entertainment industry, they will not substitute human creativity in serving entertainment, and humans will always cherish entertainment served by humans and treat machine-generated entertainment as fiction.",Artificial Intelligence for Smart Technology in the Hospitality and Tourism Industry,2024-07-05,,0.13903761989441024

Managing processes on mobile devices: The marple approach,"Ubiquitous Computing is considered as enabler for linking everyday life with information and communication technology. However, developing pervasive applications that provide personalized user assistance is still a challenge. Relevant scenarios are diverse and encompass domains like healthcare, logistics, and business collaboration. Two of the technologies that show increasing maturity in respect to the demands of such applications are light-weight frameworks and process engines for mobile computing. Their fusion, however, is in a rather premature state. Generally, the support of mobile collaboration using a process engine raises challenging issues that need to be addressed. In the MARPLE project we target at a tight integration of process management technology with mobile computing frameworks in order to enable mobile process support in the aforementioned scenarios. In this demo paper we give insights into the MARPLE architecture and its components. In particular, we introduce the MARPLE process engine which enables light-weight as well as exible process support on mobile devices.",CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2010-12-01,,0.132510284716109

A quickly deployed and UAS-based logistics network for delivery of critical medical goods during healthcare system stress periods: A real use case in Valencia (Spain),"On the one hand, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) have experienced great applicability surge in the recent years, arising as a promising technology with a wide field of use. On the other hand, healthcare, a critical system in modern society, is subject to a heavy and unexpected pressure in the case of situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This article aims to leverage the flexibility of UASs as complementary support for healthcare logistic systems when under high-stress conditions, via quick deployment of an air delivery network. We have defined a logistics network model and created three scenarios based on the model and current needs in Valencia (Spain). Flight tests have been performed in these scenarios, which include urban areas and controlled airspace. Operations complied with requirements derived from the application of Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA) methodology, recently adopted by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Flights were successful, being able to swiftly deliver medical goods without requiring any dedicated infrastructure. However, a moderate number of contingencies took place during the tests, mainly related to control link quality and Air Traffic Management (ATM) integration, forcing the use of dedicated procedures to cope with them. Although additional development is required to ensure the safety of large-scale automated operations, the use of UASs as part of logistic networks is a feasible means to support existing structures, especially in situations in dire need.",Drones,2021-01-01,10.3390/DRONES5010013,0.12748304068719157

A case study: Application of network clock model to heterogeneous sensor networks,"A sensor network consists of sensor nodes that have sensing, computation and wireless communication capabilities. There are various sensor network applications, including disaster relief operations, environmental monitoring and control, precision agriculture, intelligent home and buildings, facility management, machine surveillance and preventive maintenance, medicine and healthcare, logistics, telematics, and others. Many of these applications share some basic functionalities, namely event detection, periodic measurement and tracking, all of which entail collecting and forwarding of event data. For the purposes of triggering an action, it is necessary to know when an event occurs. Certainly time is an essential factor in many sensor network applications. This paper proposes, based on a cast study, a network clock model application to heterogeneous sensor networks. The network clock model is a scheme by which a consistent notion of time can be shared among sensor networks’ devices in order to enable the combination of time and data for applications. This work serves to demonstrate the acquisition, keeping and distribution of standard time in a heterogeneous sensor network platform based on the network clock model.",Journal of Communications,2019-07-01,10.12720/jcm.14.7.587-592,0.11446171337967652

The future of asset management,"Deming was famous for asking people, ""By What Method?"" an objective would be accomplished. Any useful concept has embedded in it the answer to that question. Asset Management, to be a valuable concept, must demonstrate a method that leads to success. The method should be inclusive of all the necessary elements, yet be simple to understand. We present a broader view of Asset Management here, built upon three core operating functions: Lead, Execute and Enable. The Execute function is always performed in the plant environment. Manufacturing success is relative to the competition however. Whoever can make the best products at the lowest cost will win. Lead and Enable are the great determinants of that relative success. In addition, Physical Asset Management has an identity crisis. Most practitioners use the term synonymously with the maintenance function. Asset Management's opportunity, however, goes beyond maintenance to be a guiding principal for all of manufacturing. This paper explores the four integrated facets of the Execute function in the plant: Capacity acquisition and disposition Production Asset Healthcare Logistics Our model, then, represents the Future of Asset Management, suggesting ""The Method"", necessary elements for successful manufacturing.","Proceedings of the 1st World Congress on Engineering Asset Management, WCEAM 2006",2006-01-01,10.1007/978-1-84628-814-2_50,0.10251819093290389

An Automated Enhancement System of Diabetic Retinopathy Fundus Image for Eye Care Facilities,"Examining retinal fundus images is compulsory for ophthalmologists to spot features of eye diseases. Some problems, including low contrast and blurred retinal fundus image, may seriously affect the diagnostic procedure, leading to misdiagnosis. Low quality of retinal fundus image makes recognition of features for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) to be harder for the ophthalmologist. Moreover, there is a lack of eye care facilities infrastructure with ophthalmologists to serve multi-morbid DR patients in rural areas, specifically Malaysia. Hence, this research proposed the development of an automated enhancement system based on computer vision and the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field to improve the quality of fundus images captured. The DR Enhancement System (DRES) helps ophthalmologists in the screening aspect by improving the detection of aberrant fundus images. Several methods for improving the fundus image are utilized: Retinex, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and Low-light enhancement. Results show that all methods performed better when improving low-contrast and blurred images. This study contributes to the screening process of DR by improving the quality of the retinal fundus image. The developed AI-based system can also help to solve healthcare logistics problems of reaching DR patients in rural areas.",Communications in Computer and Information Science,2024-01-01,10.1007/978-981-99-9592-9_8,0.06824036197654448
A multi-agents system for solving facility layout problem: Application to operating theater,"Facility layout problem (FLP) has a great impact on the efficiency of any organization. It is concerned with defining the optimal location for each facility in order to optimize the supply chain productivity. In this kind of problems, the choice of resolution approach depends on the complexity and the size of the problem. Operating theaters are generally big structures containing a lot of facilities, which makes the conception of their layout a complex problem. In the literature, exact methods are powerless when faced with problem sizes up to 18 facilities. This leads us to explore other approaches, looking for efficient solutions. This paper presents a novel approach using a multi-agents system where agents' skills are exploited to cover a wide research space, to accelerate the decision-making process and to deal with real-life problem sizes. This decision-making tool is based on several mixed integer linear programming models for solving the FLP, and considers two types of environments with deterministic and variant patient demand. Several experiments have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and several problem instances with >80 facilities have been solved in reasonable time.",Journal of Intelligent Systems,2021-01-01,10.1515/jisys-2017-0081,0.06287915099725204
Hybrid predetection technique for efficient tag identification in radio-frequency identification systems,"Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is a noncontact automatic identification technology that has been widely used in various modern industries. Due to the continuous improvement in sensing capabilities, energy autonomy, affordability, and usability, RFID is one of the key enabling technologies in realizing the Internet of Things (IoT). With their non-line-of-sight wireless transmission, wireless power, and sensing capability, lightweight RFID sensor tags can be connected to people or objects, which is crucial for future IoT applications such as healthcare, logistics, and manufacturing. The RFID approach with the simultaneous reading of multiple tag features can quickly identify connected “things” for further data communication and integration. Reducing the identification processing time for many tags located inside the interrogation range of the reader is essential. Therefore, an effective protocol must be developed to prevent collisions and reduce useless queries between the reader and tags to achieve rapid identification. Predetection tree-based algorithms, which are based on certain small predetection timeslots that tags can respond to, can eliminate unnecessary idle slots and prevent collision slots. In this paper, an efficient predetection-based anticollision algorithm has been proposed to achieve outstanding tag identification performance. The numbers of collision slots and idle slots are reduced by exploiting a novel predetection mechanism and slot size adjustment technique. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme reduces the tag identification time by approximately 30-60% compared with previously proposed predetection-based protocols. Moreover, the numbers of query cycles, collisions, and slots are smaller in the proposed scheme than in the previously proposed protocols.",Sensors and Materials,2021-01-01,10.18494/SAM.2021.3381,0.058832597931084134
"Enterprise IoT Modeling: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning","The Internet of Things (IoT)—the internetworking of physical devices—has been a significant advancement in recent decades and has been the catalyst for several other innovations. New Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platforms aim to solve the most complex challenge of manufacturers: consolidating all production systems into a single data model. They are used in smart cities, security and emergencies, environmental applications, energy, healthcare, logistics, industrial control, home automation, agriculture, and animal farming. These objects/devices/appliances can generate, collect, and exchange data without human-to-human or human-to-computer interactions. The IIoT is creating an explosion in structured and unstructured data from a growing army of sensors capable of registering locations, voices, faces, audio, temperature, sentiment, health, and others. Billions of IoT devices are interconnected and a huge volume of data is generated. Every device features automation to assist people in the planning, management, and decision-making of their day-to-day activities. Machine learning (ML) techniques are applied to further enhance the intelligence and capabilities of an application. Many researchers are interested in producing advanced IoT technology, combining ML and IoT Techniques. Through ML, IIoT devices learn to perform tasks such as predication, pattern recognition, classification, and clustering. To provide for a learning process, IoT devices are trained using various algorithms in ML and statistical models to analyze sample data. The various fields of data sets (structured and unstructured data) are characterized by measuring functional parameters. Later, ML algorithms are applied to the data set to find features, provide useful output, identify patterns or make decisions based on the data set, draw inferences from real-time data streams, make their results available to analysts, and embed their results directly in business processes.

Smart objects in healthcare: Impact on clinical logistics,"Hospitals are confronted today with a plethora of approaches for asset management with RFID and WLAN, cooling chain monitoring using sensor networks and RFID, and patient tracking using virtually any existing technology. The downside is that most approaches are not necessarily compatible let alone coordinated. Further, none of the technologies is really integrated into legacy systems or corresponding organizational structures and processes, thus the full power of innovative applications is not utilized. Introducing the concept of smart objects inspired by the Internet of Things can improve the situation by separating the capabilities and functions of an object from the implementing technology such as RFID or WLAN. Wireless tags become interchangeable, and business applications can be built independent from the underlying communication network. Supported by synchronized technological and business developments smart objects have the power to transform a hospital from an agglomeration of technologies into a smart environment.",Critical Issues for the Development of Sustainable E-health Solutions,2012-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4614-1536-7_19,0.03853255710846644

This becomes extremely important if high exibility demands need to be fulfilled during process execution, while PAIS robustness and error safety need to be assured. In this software demonstration we show how the AristaFlow BPM Suite { an adaptive process management system developed by us { was applied to challenging applications in domains like healthcare, logistics, disaster management, and software development.

Importance of 5G-enabled IoT for industrial automation,"5G-enabled IoT can make a significant contribution to society by providing and advancing intelligent services for human beings. The applications of 5G-enabled IoT range to all society segments, such as industry, agriculture, environment, traffic, healthcare, logistics, and many more. Thus, it comes up as a good topic to research and makes the masses aware of it. The scale by which human lives will be made more accessible, productive, secure, and healthy and the need for this to be brought forward by the masses serve as the motivation for this chapter. In this chapter, we describe 5G-enabled IoT and its importance in the modern industries. It should detail upon applications of 5G-enabled IoT, which are assumed to bring revolutions like smart cities, advanced healthcare, smart homes, automated agriculture, autonomous vehicles, intelligent supply chain management, and how all the applications will reduce cost and labor. We shall also briefly touch upon some of the disadvantages and some rumors of the upcoming fifth generation of the Internet, making the people stand against these modern technologies' uprise. 5G is the fifth generation of wireless technology.

The advent of additive manufacturing (AM) as a manufacturing process has the potential to revolutionize a host of enterprise-related functions from production to the supply chain. The unprecedented level of design flexibility and expanded functionality offered by AM, coupled with greatly reduced lead times, can potentially pave the way for mass customization. However, widespread application of AM is currently hampered by technical challenges in process repeatability and quality management. The breakthrough effect of six sigma (6S) has been demonstrated in traditional manufacturing industries (e.g., semiconductor and automotive industries) in the context of quality planning, control, and improvement through the intensive use of data, statistics, and optimization. 6S entails a data-driven DMAIC methodology of five steps - define, measure, analyze, improve, and control. Notwithstanding the sustained successes of the 6S knowledge body in a variety of established industries ranging from manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, and beyond, there is a dearth of concentrated application of 6S quality management approaches in the context of AM. In this article, we propose to design, develop, and implement the new DMAIC methodology for the 6S quality management of AM. First, we define the specific quality challenges arising from AM layerwise fabrication and mass customization (even one-of-a-kind production). Second, we present a review of AM metrology and sensing techniques, from materials through design, process, and environment, to postbuild inspection. Third, we contextualize a framework for realizing the full potential of data from AM systems and emphasize the need for analytical methods and tools. We propose and delineate the utility of new data-driven analytical methods, including deep learning, machine learning, and network science, to characterize and model the interrelationships between engineering design, machine setting, process variability, and final build quality. Fourth, we present the methodologies of ontology analytics, design of experiments (DOE), and simulation analysis for AM system improvements. In closing, new process control approaches are discussed to optimize the action plans, once an anomaly is detected, with specific consideration of lead time and energy consumption. We posit that this work will catalyze more in-depth investigations and multidisciplinary research efforts to accelerate the application of 6S quality management in AM.",Proceedings of the IEEE,2021-04-01,10.1109/JPROC.2020.3034519,0.019381011262759342

A Pattern Adherence Analysis to a Blockchain Web Application,"Blockchain is an emerging technology that is attracting a lot of attention from both academia and industry. Blockchain when used as a decentralized technology could be utilized in various useful applications, such as healthcare, logistics, supply chain management, education, among others. However, there is the integration factor between technologies and environments, which have their own characteristics and challenges. A pattern is a solution with reusable fetures for a problem that commonly occurs in a given context during software design phases. Usually, when adopting a design pattern, there are trade-offs among quality attributes. In this context, using patterns can promote a better use for blockchain in traditional application and system development, and disseminate best practices. The aim of this paper is to analyze a traditional web application that uses blockchain features from the viewpoint of some patterns, specifically patterns that describe the blockchain integration with the outside world. As a result, we found that applying blockchain patterns can benefit systems, especially those that require integration with other systems, such as legacy or existing.","Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture Companion, ICSA-C 2020",2020-03-01,10.1109/ICSA-C50368.2020.00028,0.010725007864400067
Scalability improvement and analysis of permissioned-blockchain,"Through the Bitcoin application, the innovative technology was miraculously launched in the markets, influencing numerous industries.

Study and Analysis of Discrete Event-Driven Autonomous System with a Case Study for a Robotics Task,"Highly probabilistic, potential, and dynamic domains are only relatively known to contribute classical techniques for complex system establishment impossible. Currently available technologies and strategies do not adequately address these novel needs. Thus, by enabling autonomous systems to adapt, decision-making and learning abilities, we can empower them with sufficient and appropriate expertise to recognize and address such issues. To address these requirements, discrete event-driven systems (DEDS) have been developed. This system can help the technologists of future autonomous systems by simulating the effect of auxiliary designs on the performance of the autonomous system. For modeling regular feedback of performance that is influenced by traditional techniques and depends on trust, the discrete event-driven method is most suited. This paper describes the DEDS system, the modeling of this system, and as well as the supervisory control system by explaining the supervisor, and partial supervisor. A comprehensive literature survey has been carried out in this article to explain the controllability, diagnosability, and observability potential of the DEDS system for various applications. Some of the major areas of applications such as healthcare, logistics, robotics, and banking sectors, have been discussed. Also, we have explained this system with the help of modeling a discrete event system for a queuing problem associated with robotics tasks as an example by the simulation with MATLAB 2022a. Lastly, the possible future research directions in the DEDS advancement have been provided.",Przeglad Elektrotechniczny,2023-01-01,10.15199/48.2023.09.09,0.004468593812458507
