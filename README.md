# AI-driven Comprehensive Abstract Screening (ACAS)

Machine-learning based tool for automated abstract screening for systematic literature reviews (SLR). The tool works by viewing the choice of including a reference into the literature or not as a supervised machine learning (binary classification) problem. It allows the decision maker to leverage a small number of manually classified abstracts.
