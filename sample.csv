"Logistics for a fleet of drones for medical item delivery: A case study for Louisville, KY","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, commonly referred to as drones, have been widely acknowledged as a promising technology for the delivery of medical and aid packages in humanitarian and healthcare logistics. In this study, we develop an optimization model to optimize the logistics for a fleet of drones for timely delivery of medical items (e.g., medicines, test kits, and vaccines) to hard-to-access locations (i.e., rural and suburban areas). We propose a novel timeslot formulation that schedules and sequences a set of trips to serve several demand locations. On each trip, a drone starts from an urban provider, visits one or more charging platforms (if required), serves a clinic in rural or suburban areas, and returns to the corresponding provider. The problem consists of selecting locations for charging stations, assigning clinics to providers, and scheduling and sequencing the trips such that the total completion time to serve all demand points is minimized. To improve the computational efficiency of the solution method, we use a preprocessing procedure to reduce the solution space by eliminating the dominated trips from the pool of trips. A set of numerical experiments is performed on simulated instances and on a case study in Louisville, KY. The results unveil interesting insights into the logistics of the proposed drone delivery system.",Computers and Operations Research,01/11/2021,10.1016/j.cor.2021.105443,0

Intellectual property issues in artificial intelligence: Specific reference to the service sector,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed almost every field of the service sector, such as finance, healthcare logistics, automotive and aviation. The innovative technologies can identify uneven patterns like spam filtering or payment deceit, and make aware businesses in actual time about questionable activities, hence are helpful in the growth of a market. These innovation and creation are protected under different forms of intellectual property (IP). However, the transformation from AI related inventions to AI lead inventions has raised substantial challenges to the existing IP infrastructure. This study aims at looking into different aspects of AI related IP protection with an elaborative analysis of the patenting trends through landscape analysis of AI in the service sector. It is observed that AI is playing a pivotal role in the transformation of the service sector due to its accelerating use. But the issues related to legal and ethical need to be addressed for effective utilisation of AI related invention and creation in the service sector.","International Journal of Technological Learning, Innovation and Development",01/01/2021,10.1504/IJTLID.2021.114920,0
Nonmedical barriers to early steps in kidney transplantation among underrepresented groups in the United States,"Purpose of reviewDespite numerous targeted interventions and policy reforms, underrepresented minorities and patients with low socioeconomic status (SES) continue to have unequal a to kidney transplant. In this review, we summarize the most recent evidence on barriers to early kidney transplant steps (i.e. referral and evaluation) among underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities and low SES groups in the United States.Recent findingsThis review highlights the interconnectedness of several patient-level (e.g. medical mistrust, transplant knowledge, a to care), provider-level (e.g. dialysis profit status, patient-provider communication; staff aibility), and system-level (e.g. center-specific criteria, healthcare logistics, neighborhood poverty, healthcare logistics) factors associated with lower rates of referral and evaluation among underrepresented minorities and low SES groups, and the influence of systemic racism operating at all levels.SummaryCollection of national surveillance data on early transplant steps, as well as routinely captured data on upstream social determinants of health, including the measurement of racism rather than race, is necessary to enhance our understanding of barriers to referral and evaluation. A multipronged approach (e.g.Targeted and systemwide interventions, and policy change) implemented at multiple levels of the healthcare system will be necessary to reduce disparities in early transplant steps.",Current Opinion in Organ Transplantation,01/10/2021,10.1097/MOT.0000000000000903,1

Overall user satisfaction with family planning services and associated quality care factors: A cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Studies of user satisfaction with family planning services (FPSs) have been conducted in different countries, and have been employed to identify ways of improving health, reducing costs and implementing reforms. The present work is the first-ever study undertaken in Mexico on the subject. Our objective was to identify how overall user satisfaction with FPSs in Mexico was related to: healthcare logistics, the functional value of services and the quality of interpersonal relations. Methods: Users of 18 public clinics were surveyed in 2015. Data collected referred to their past and present use of FPSs, as well as to their perceptions of the services provided. We built a logistic regression model with potentially influential variables in order to assess their association with overall satisfaction. Results: According to the self-reports of the 722 users interviewed, the following factors were decisive in their overall satisfaction with services: receiving sufficient information during visits (OR = 3.38; 95% CI:1.88-6.06), feeling that their opinions were taken into consideration by clinic staff (OR = 2.58; 95% CI:1.14-5.85), feeling that the motives for their visits were addressed (OR = 2.71; 95% CI:1.29-5.71), being assigned enough time for consultation (OR = 2.35; 95% CI:1.26-4.37), having the opportunity to ask questions and clarify doubts (OR = 2.31; 95% CI:1.21-4.43), experiencing no or few interruptions during their medical consultations (OR = 1.97;95% CI:1.10-3.51), and feeling satisfied with the contraceptive method provided (OR = 1.79; 95% CI:1.03-3.11). Conclusions: Service providers must be kept well informed on the perspective of users concerning user expectations. Taking into account the cultural context and perceived needs of users while providing service would improve the quality of care and, hence, the overall satisfaction of users.",Reproductive Health,12/10/2018,10.1186/s12978-018-0615-3,1
"Prioritizing interdependent drivers of financial, economic, and political risks using a data-driven probabilistic approach","Financial, economic, and political risks pose a significant threat to the development and progress of countries as such risks can impact all spheres of life including education, healthcare, logistics, transportation, and safety among others. Although these risks seem quite distinct, they are mutually influenced by multidimensional interdependent factors such as internal and external conflict, socioeconomic conditions, corruption, law and order, and bureaucratic quality among others. In this paper, we utilize a data-driven approach to explore dependencies among factors influencing financial, economic, and political risks and establish their relative importance in a network setting while capturing the entire distribution of individual factors. A probabilistic network-based model was developed using the data by the International Country Risk Guide, which revealed significant differences between the conventional and the proposed schemes for prioritizing drivers of political, economic, and financial risks. Internal conflict and socioeconomic conditions were considered as the most critical factors in terms of reducing and enhancing the network-wide risk exposure, respectively. The two prioritization schemes relative to the vulnerability and resilience impact of individual factors are not correlated and therefore, policy-makers need to focus on both schemes while developing risk mitigation strategies.",Risk Management,01/06/2022,10.1057/s41283-022-00089-8,1
An iterated local search for the biomedical sample transportation problem with multiple and interdependent pickups,"This article addresses a new version of the biomedical sample transportation problem, as a vehicle routing problem with precedence constraints arising in the context of healthcare logistics, and proposes an iterated local search algorithm to solve it. This new version is more realistic and complex since it considers the collection centres’ opening hours and the moment at which they are visited as decision variables, granting additional flexibility to elaborate more efficient routes. Indeed, this problem is harder to model and to solve than its previous version because the constraint on the short samples’ lifetime leads to interdependency between successive pickups at each collection center. A metaheuristic is thus proposed to solve real-life instances. Numerical experiments confirm (1) the value of simultaneously planning routes, opening hours, and visit hours (which is new in the literature) and (2) the efficiency of the proposed algorithm to solve this problem.",Journal of the Operational Research Society,01/01/2021,10.1080/01605682.2019.1657369,1
Paving the way for warehouse centralization in healthcare: A preliminary assessment approach,"Centralized logistics management is currently one interesting option for healthcare systems facing an increasing need to improve responsiveness and service quality while reducing costs. This work focuses on one aspect of centralized logistics, namely warehouse centralization and proposes a preliminary approach to assess material management in healthcare institutions as a first step towards decisions about the implementation of such a strategy. A list of variables and relationships between them characterizing warehouse material management are identified based on a literature review and knowledge of real logistics processes. Statistical analysis is then applied to assess the existence of such relationships in a set of healthcare organizations in order to understand the management commonalities that can stimulate warehouse centralization as well as the criticalities that could potentially hinder it. The approach is tested in a healthcare logistics system in Northern Italy. The results proved the ability of the methodology to identify the relevant issues the involved institutions need to work on when undertaking warehouse centralization strategies. The case warehouses revealed a good degree of commonalities in their management practices although three critical aspects were identified, namely a limited efficiency in human resource allocation, a high fragmentation of stock product demand and a relevant number of stock products with low annual demand. This work provides a methodology to increase material managers’ awareness about the factors enabling successful centralized inventory strategies in the healthcare sector.",American Journal of Applied Sciences,05/05/2016,10.3844/ajassp.2016.490.500,1
Six Sigma Application in Healthcare Logistics: A Framework and A Case Study,"Six Sigma is used heavily in various industrial sectors, yet no noticeable applications are seen in healthcare logistics.

The iet in service industries,"Were you aware that consumers spend 60% of their dollars on services versus only 12% on durable goods? These statistics underscore data showing that in the past 10 years employment in manufacturing sector has declined from over 17% to just 11%, while employment in health care, logistics, and other service industries has risen from 13% to 17%. Recent articles in a wide variety of publications, discuss the carry-over of industrial engineering technology tools and techniques from manufacturing to the service industries. Industrial Engineering Technology courses focus on the goals of improving productivity, quality, and safety while reducing costs. Since these goals are suited to any industry, regardless of its economic sector, students in the Industrial Engineering Technology program are uniquely suited to transition from employment opportunities in manufacturing industries to employment opportunities in service enterprises. IET programs have always been known for maintaining excellence through innovative courses, class activities, and the exploration of new fields of opportunity. Now more than ever, IET programs need to expand their knowledge and use of service industry applications. As global competition continues to grow and U.S. service industries multiply, our IET graduates should be poised to meet the challenges unique to the service industries. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the changes necessary to enable IET programs to seriously integrate topics from healthcare, logistics, e-business, and other service industries into its core courses. It will also discuss how curricula changes will enhance students' skill set, increase the variety of their job opportunities upon graduation, and enable us to market our programs more effectively to a broader range of potential students in the future. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2006.","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",01/01/2006,,0
A Decision Support Tool for the Location Routing Problem During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Colombia,"During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Bogotá, Colombia, some strategies for dealing with the increasing number of infected people and the level of occupation of intensive care units include the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). PPE is a crucial component for patient care and a priority for protecting healthcare workers. For attending this necessity, the location of distribution centers within the city and the corresponding routes to supply the intensive care units (ICU) with PPE have an important role. Formally, this problem is defined as the Location Routing Problem (LRP). The LRP is an NP-Hard problem that combines the Facility Location Problem (FLP) and the Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Depots (MDVRP). This work presents a decision support tool based on a simheuristic method that hybridize an Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm with Monte Carlo simulation to deal with the LRP with uncertain demands. Realistic data from Bogotá (Colombia) was retrieved using Google Maps to characterize the geographical distribution of both potential facilities and ICUs, while demands were generated using the uniform probability distribution. Our preliminary results suggest the competitiveness of the algorithm in both the deterministic and the stochastic versions of the LRP.",Communications in Computer and Information Science,01/01/2021,10.1007/978-3-030-76310-7_3,1

A Pattern Adherence Analysis to a Blockchain Web Application,"Blockchain is an emerging technology that is attracting a lot of attention from both academia and industry. Blockchain when used as a decentralized technology could be utilized in various useful applications, such as healthcare, logistics, supply chain management, education, among others. However, there is the integration factor between technologies and environments, which have their own characteristics and challenges. A pattern is a solution with reusable fetures for a problem that commonly occurs in a given context during software design phases. Usually, when adopting a design pattern, there are trade-offs among quality attributes. In this context, using patterns can promote a better use for blockchain in traditional application and system development, and disseminate best practices. The aim of this paper is to analyze a traditional web application that uses blockchain features from the viewpoint of some patterns, specifically patterns that describe the blockchain integration with the outside world. As a result, we found that applying blockchain patterns can benefit systems, especially those that require integration with other systems, such as legacy or existing.","Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture Companion, ICSA-C 2020",01/03/2020,10.1109/ICSA-C50368.2020.00028,1

Where to locate medical supplies in nursing units: An exploratory study,"Nursing unit inventory management is often cited as the top irritant that limits nurses’ ability to provide care at bedside. Our research focus is to determine whether the inventory location in the nursing units interferes with the performance of the replenishment system. The literature review suggests that a decentralization of nursing unit storage areas will require additional logistics resources to manage all of these storage points. Our case studies of four Canadian hospitals tend to demonstrate that decentralized locations do not necessarily lead to a decrease in productivity for logistics staff. Furthermore, although our research focuses on the inventory location in nursing units, it is difficult to isolate the impact of this aspect in the context of the entire replenishment system. For example, reorder frequency also has an impact on productivity. Further research could focus on these topics.",Supply Chain Forum,01/01/2018,10.1080/16258312.2018.1433438,0

Cognizant healthcare logistics management: Ensuring resilience during crisis,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to convey a message of preparedness and mitigation to key stakeholders throughout the healthcare community concerning healthcare supply chain readiness and preparedness. Design/methodology/approach: Using a review of existent literature, this work examines and expounds upon the impact of effective supply chain management processes in disaster mitigation and planning. Findings: This paper presents a discourse in supply chain managers' involvement in disaster planning, identifying courses of action, and collaboratively planning for crisis. Logistics is a specific genre of skill sets within healthcare operations. Practical implications: Key tenets of logistics readiness and preparedness are often missed when developing strategies for disaster mitigation. While this discussion is directed specifically toward healthcare management, the principles are applicable across a wide array of industries. Social implications: Disaster affects everyone and is likely to occur in any type of organization. Leaders have an inherent responsibility to plan for both expected and unexpected events; the latter can present complexities that require intuitive reaction provided scenarios have been considered in advance. Arguably, the critical path to success involves effective process management and collaborative communications across multiple echelons of managerial responsibilities.

Handling uncertainty in the specification of autonomous multi-robot systems through mission adaptation,"Multi-robot systems (MRS) have gained interest as a versatile paradigm for complex task execution across various domains such as healthcare, logistics, and maintenance. Often, they are called to operate in variable and dynamic environments, which makes uncertainties arise and affect those systems. Uncertainties require the system to be able to adapt its behavior at runtime, in response to the changing and unpredictable conditions in its operating environment. Moreover, often the behavior of the robots cannot be completely anticipated at design time. Consequently, static mission planning is not always suitable: mission specifications need to take into account the uncertainties and, hence, be dynamic and re-configurable at runtime, when the required knowledge is available.This work focuses on the realization of adaptable multi-robot systems, which are capable of dealing with uncertainties by adapting their mission at runtime. We introduce the concept of ""adaptable task"" that is used in the global mission specification of the MRS to identify the mission tasks affected by uncertainties. Adaptation alternatives are modeled as sub-missions and associated with the adaptable task. At runtime, ad hoc written ""trigger functions"" executed by robots sense and evaluate the environment and select the most suitable adaptation alternative to be executed.We have experimented with the approach by simulating a use case to assess its validity.

Logistical and structural challenges are the major obstacles for family medicine physicians’ ability to administer adult vaccines,"Purpose: This study was conducted to characterize the vaccination practices and challenges of family medicine physicians in Los Angeles County, California. Methods: The Los Angeles Academy of Family Physicians (LA AFP) sent out electronic surveys to all of their active members (N = 1121) between December 2017 and January 2018, and asked them to answer questions about themselves, their practice, their patient population, and their immunization practices and challenges. We then analyzed the results through basic statistical calculations and Pearson’s chi-squared tests. Results: Seventy-four people (6.6%) responded to the survey, and 75% of responders stated that they administer all Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended vaccines. The lowest vaccine administration rates were for the high-dose influenza vaccine, which 66.2% (n = 49) of respondents reported to administer, followed by the meningococcal B vaccine (68.9%; n = 51). The respondents who belonged to practices with more than 11 providers, were part of a large hospital or healthcare system, had electronic medical records (EMRs), and used the California Immunization Registry (CAIR) were more likely to report to vaccinate. The number one responding physician-reported challenge to vaccination was limited time and resources to address patient resistance followed by vaccine cost and lack of infrastructure to store vaccines. Conclusions: In this pilot study, structural and logistical challenges appeared to make the biggest impact on adult vaccination for the responding family medicine physicians. Solutions addressing these challenges will help improve the adult immunization rates.",Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics,04/03/2019,10.1080/21645515.2018.1543524,0

Selective vehicle routing for a mobile blood donation system,"In this study, a mobile blood collection system is designed with the primary objective of increasing blood collection levels. This design also takes into account operational costs to aim for collection of large amounts of blood at reasonable cost. Bloodmobiles perform direct tours to certain activities to collect blood, but at the end of each day, they bring the collected blood to a designated depot to prevent its spoilage. The proposed system consists of the bloodmobiles and a new vehicle called the shuttle that visits the bloodmobiles in the field on each day and transfers the collected blood to the depot. Consequently, bloodmobiles can continue their tours without having to make daily returns to the depot. We propose a mathematical model and a 2-stage IP based heuristic algorithm to determine the tours of the bloodmobiles and the shuttle, and their lengths of stay at each stop. This new problem is defined as an extension of the Selective Vehicle Routing Problem and is referred to as the SVRP with Integrated Tours. The performances of the solution methodologies are tested first on a real data set obtained from past blood donation activities of Turkish Red Crescent in Ankara, and then on a constructed data set based on GIS data of the European part of Istanbul. The Pareto set of optimum solutions is generated based on blood amounts and logistics costs, and finally a sensitivity analysis on some important design parameters is conducted.",European Journal of Operational Research,16/08/2015,10.1016/j.ejor.2015.03.007,1
Optimal Multikey Homomorphic Encryption with Steganography Approach for Multimedia Security in Internet of Everything Environment,"Recent developments of semiconductor and communication technologies have resulted in the interconnection of numerous devices in offering seamless communication and services, which is termed as Internet of Everything (IoE). It is a subset of Internet of Things (IoT) which finds helpful in several applications namely smart city, smart home, precise agriculture, healthcare, logistics, etc. Despite the benefits of IoE, it is limited to processing and storage abilities, resulting in the degrada-tion of device safety, privacy, and efficiency. Security and privacy become major concerns in the transmission of multimedia data over the IoE network. Encryption and image steganography is considered effective solutions to accomplish secure data transmission in the IoE environment. For resolving the limitations of the existing works, this article proposes an optimal multikey homomorphic encryption with steganography approach for multimedia security (OMKHES‐MS) technique in the IoE environment. Primarily, singular value decomposition (SVD) model is applied for the separation of cover images into RGB elements. Besides, optimum pixel selection process is carried out using coyote optimization algorithm (COA). At the same time, the encryption of secret images is performed using poor and rich optimization (PRO) with multikey homomorphic encryption (MKHE) technique. Finally, the cipher image is embedded into the chosen pixel values of the cover image to generate stego image. For assessing the better outcomes of the OMKHES‐MS model, a wide range of experiments were carried out. The extensive comparative analysis reported the su-premacy of the proposed model over the rennet approaches interms of different measures.",Applied Sciences (Switzerland),01/04/2022,10.3390/app12084026,1
A Mobile Healthcare Service Routing and Scheduling Problem in Rural Areas,"A change in health policy become essential since healthcare needs of societies have changed over the past sixty years. It is not possible to build a hospital wherever people live especially in less populated settlements. However, equal access of people to health services must be ensured by governments. To tackle this issue, Turkey Ministry of Health has enforced to give mobile healthcare services in rural areas by approximately 7.5 thousand doctors located in 3.4 thousand medical centers. These doctors work 8 h/day and give mobile healthcare service to approximately 9 million people each month. This study considers Turkey rural healthcare delivery system as a Multi-depot Time Constrained Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem (md-TCPVRP) and presents a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the problem. The goal is to derive daily routes of the doctors each month, under some constraints such as maximum workhours, route duration, minimum service time per visit, assigning dedicated doctors to villages while minimizing the total route distance. In order to investigate the performance of the model a computational experiment is carried. The real-life application of Health Directorate of the province and proposed mathematical model results are compared. Computational results show significant improvements in total distances.",Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies,01/01/2021,10.1007/978-3-030-79203-9_11,0
Methods and concepts for elaborating a decision aided tool for optimizing healthcare medicines dispatching flows,"Globalization and new technologies are causes of the development of industry 4.0 concepts. Nowadays, Industry is becoming increasingly technological, machines are reaching spaces previously destined in factories to humans. Indeed, industry 4.0 concepts based on scientific, technological, and organizational concepts & tools (Internet of thing, RFID, Cobots, decision aided tools) and including sustainability could be used in different activity sectors. Healthcare sector is being transformed by new technologies and complex problems of this sector are solved by insisting on new technological parameters. FEI and Icam engineering schools are collaborating on healthcare logistics & transport area. The idea is to use the previous approach being elaborated for industrial companies to improve healthcare logistics and transport domain (Healthcare logistics 4.0). This paper presents concepts and tools (healthcare logistics 4.0) for solving real healthcare logistics problems. The approach elaborated is hybrid (combination of experimentation for acquiring real data and design for elaborating concepts and methods required for developing an adapted problem-solving tool). The decision aided tool is elaborated by using formalisms of artificial intelligence (such as expert systems, machine learning, multi-agent systems) in order to optimize medicine dispatching flows in a hospital. After describing healthcare logistics dispatching problems, a literature review will be presented for choosing concepts and formalisms that could be for developing the new decisional tool.

Implementation of a new echocardiographic practice during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Due to the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, healthcare logistics have changed abruptly and significantly in all medical specialties, of which cardiovascular services are no exception. Assessment of urgent and priority cases did not stop, both medical personnel and patients required adaptation of personal protective measures to prevent the spread of a highly contagious and potentially fatal virus for this vulnerable population with cardiovascular disease. In the time that has elapsed since the beginning of said pandemic to date, the health sector has become immersed in a fortuitous and challenging situation for its work environment. Considering that this virus could remain endemic, it is necessary to devise a protocol for a gradual and safe reincorporation of services at all levels of care. This document provides an update on recommendations for the return to a safe but no less efficient echocardiographic practice, based on expert opinions, some international guidelines along with evidence available until recently on several main echocardiographic findings in patients with cardiovascular disease by COVID-19, providing a general approach that can be adapted to the guidelines of each health institution in this country.",Cardiovascular and Metabolic Science,01/10/2020,10.35366/97548,0
Fractal-Based N-Environment Multi-Agent IoT System Reliability,"The tremendous growth of Internet of Things (IoT) systems and the popularity of distributed systems, which were brought back into fashion by containerisation, create new challenges for system maintenance. Each IoT-specific service is characterised by a specific domain, or environment, making the maintenance of distributed IoT systems with dozens of agents a challenging task. This paper proposes a fractal-based mathematical model, called the fractal multi-agent IoT system (FMAIS), for scalable multi-agent systems (e.g. cloud-native services, wide-scale IoT services). A reliability estimation model called the multi-environment enhanced real-time customer-oriented reliability estimation (ME-ERT-CORE) model is proposed as a method for estimating the reliability of a multi-agent IoT system, where each agent can be specified by its own domain-specific environment (e.g. healthcare, logistics, smart factories, etc.). An estimation of the time complexity of the FMAIS is performed, and a model called ME-ERT-CORE for estimating its reliability is formulated. The results show that the FMAIS can be used for real-time simulations of system behaviour and ME-ERT-CORE can be used for the real-time estimation of its reliability, monitoring purposes, and, for instance, quality of service (QoS) descriptions based on service level agreement (SLA) requirements. The conducted measurements show that the reliability of the FMAIS with 4 layers and 96 applications, where each application deploys 96 instances, can be computed in 8.022 milliseconds. With the proposed optimisation method, the reliability for the same FMAIS can be computed in 0.219 milliseconds, which is 36 times faster than the ME-ERT-CORE reliability evaluation based on the definition. An FMAIS with the aforementioned parameters can be simulated in 84.300 milliseconds.",IEEE Internet of Things Journal,01/01/2024,10.1109/JIOT.2024.3398406,1

Service modularity in managing healthcare logistics,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how modularity is used for enabling value creation in managing healthcare logistics services. Design/methodology/approach: Material logistics of four different kinds of hospitals is examined through a qualitative case study. The theoretical framework builds on the literature on healthcare logistics, service modularity and value creation. Findings: The case hospitals have developed their material logistics independently from others when looking at the modularity of offerings, processes and organisations. Services, such as assortment management, shelving and developing an information platform, have been performed in-house partly by the care personnel, but steps towards modularised and standardised solutions are now being taken in the case hospitals, including ideas about outsourcing some of the services. Research limitations/implications: This paper proposes seven modularity components for healthcare logistics management: segmentation, categorisation and unitisation of offerings, differentiation and decoupling of processes, and centralisation and specialisation of organisations. Thus, this study clarifies the three-dimensional concept of modularity as a cognitive frame for managing logistics services with heterogeneous customer needs in a rapidly changing healthcare environment. Practical implications: Modularity offers a tool for developing logistics services inside the hospital and increases possibilities to consider also external logistics service providers. Social implications: Managing healthcare logistics services through modularity has potential social implications in developing healthcare processes and changing the usage of health services. On a wider scale, modularity is helping healthcare systems reaching their goals in terms of service quality and cost. Originality/value: This paper shows the context-specific antecedents of service modularity and the usage of modular thinking in managing healthcare logistics.",International Journal of Logistics Management,12/02/2019,10.1108/IJLM-12-2017-0338,0
A structured review of quantitative models of the pharmaceutical supply chain,"The aim of this review is to identify and provide a structured overview of quantitative models in the pharmaceutical supply chain, a subject not exhaustively studied in the previous reviews on healthcare logistics related mostly to quantitative models in healthcare or logistics studies in hospitals. The models are classified into three categories of classification: network design, inventory models, and optimization of a pharmaceutical supply chain. A taxonomy for each category is shown describing the principal features of each echelon included in the review; this taxonomy allows the readers to identify easily a paper based on the actors of the pharmaceutical supply chain. The search process included research articles published in the databases between 1984 and November 2016. In total 46 studies were included. In the review process we found that in the three fields the most common source of uncertainty used is the demand in the 56% of the cases. Within the review process we can conclude that most of the articles in the literature are focused on the optimization of the pharmaceutical supply chain and inventory models but the field on supply chain network design is not deeply studied.",Complexity,01/01/2017,10.1155/2017/5297406,0
