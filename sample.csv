Non-medical barriers in access to early steps of kidney transplantation in the United States – A scoping review,"Background: In the United States (US), barriers in access to later steps in the kidney transplantation process (i.e. waitlisting) have been well documented. Barriers in access to earlier steps (i.e. referral and evaluation) are less well described due to the lack of national surveillance data. In this review, we summarize the available literature on non-medical barriers in access to kidney transplant referral and evaluation. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a scoping review of the literature through June 3, 2021. We included all studies (quantitative and qualitative) reporting on barriers to kidney transplant referral and evaluation in the US published from 1990 onwards in English and among adult end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42014015027). We narratively synthesized results across studies. Results: We retrieved information from 33 studies published from 1990 to 2021 (reporting data between 1990 and 2018). Most studies (n = 28, 85%) described barriers among patient populations, three (9%) among provider populations, and two (6%) included both patients and providers. Key barriers were identified across multiple levels and included patient- (e.g. demographic, socioeconomic, sociocultural, and knowledge), provider- (e.g. miscommunication, staff availability, provider perceptions and attitudes), and system- (e.g. geography, distance to care, healthcare logistics) level factors. Conclusions: A multi-pronged approach (e.g. targeted and systemwide interventions, and policy change) implemented at multiple levels of the healthcare system will be necessary to reduce identified barriers in access to early kidney transplant steps. Collection of national surveillance data on these early kidney transplant steps is also needed to enhance our understanding of barriers to referral and evaluation.",Transplantation Reviews,01/12/2021,10.1016/j.trre.2021.100654,1
The impact of counterfeit risk management on healthcare supply chain performance: an empirical analysis,"Purpose: This study develops and tests a model exploring the relationship between supply chain (SC) counterfeit risk management and performance in the healthcare supply chain (HCSC). Design/methodology/approach: In the proposed theoretical model, HCSC counterfeit risk management is characterized by HCSC counterfeit risk orientation (HCRO), HCSC counterfeit risk mitigation (HCRM) and HCSC risk management integration (HRMI), while performance is represented by healthcare logistics performance (HLP) and healthcare organization overall performance (HOP). Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and survey data from 55 HCSC managers are used to test the research hypotheses. Findings: HCRO has a significant positive effect on HCRM, while HCRM has a positive impact on HRMI. With respect to HLP, HCRM has a nonsignificant effect, while HRMI has a significant impact, thus confirming the important mediating role of HRMI. Finally, HLP has a significant positive effect on the overall performance of healthcare organizations. Research limitations/implications: All study participants were from the United States, limiting the generalizability of the study findings to different countries or regions. The sample size employed in the study did not allow the authors to distinguish among the different types of healthcare organizations. Originality/value: This study delineates between a healthcare organization's philosophy toward counterfeiting risks vs actions taken to eliminate or reduce the impact of counterfeiting on the HCSC. By offering firm-level guidance for managers, this study informs healthcare organizations about addressing the challenge of counterfeiting in the HCSC.",International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management,16/08/2022,10.1108/IJPPM-08-2020-0426,1
Hospital-Location Classification and Analysis in the Healthcare Cold Chain using K-means Algorithm,"Logistics and supply chain management for the healthcare sector is concerned with activities related to production, storage, and distribution. Relevant stakeholders are from various parties, which are inclusive of material supplier, manufacturer, distribution center, regional hospital, provincial hospital, as well as patients. In this research, we analyze the locational data of hospital using a case study of hospitals in Thailand to evaluate potential locational center acting as a central storage and distribution centers. Initially, we apply the K-means algorithm to classify hospital locational data into a specified number of classification groups. Then, the location model based on rectilinear distance is formulated and minimized to evaluate potential locations for the central storage and distribution centers. Our initial study provides promising result and is subject to the on-going development of the healthcare cold chain model in our research study.","8th International Conference on Engineering and Emerging Technologies, ICEET 2022",01/01/2022,10.1109/ICEET56468.2022.10007286,1
Capacity planning in healthcare: Finding solutions for healthy planning in nursing home care,"Matching supply and demand in nursing home practice is not straightforward, as it always takes place within a 'client-care worker-organizational' triangle. This chapter illustrates how data-driven capacity planning can support nursing homes in their search for ways to further increase their efficiency while maintaining an appropriate quality level of care. This is done using a framework based on a four-step approach adopted from workforce management in call centres. In addition, it is also shown that data-driven capacity planning allows for a more evenly spread workload for the care workers.","Integrating the Organization of Health Services, Worker Wellbeing and Quality of Care: Towards Healthy Healthcare",25/01/2021,10.1007/978-3-030-59467-1_8,1

In particular the analysis concerns the adoption of the automated cabinet system, ICT solution implemented by an Italian region, and the main organisational implications connected to the use of such a system. The research questions are: Does the automated cabinet system allow the healthcare system to improve the quality of patient care and reduce costs? If so, what are the most important processes and actors in pharmaceutical logistics innovation, and what is their role? The peculiarities detected by this study confirmed that the drug distribution and consumption system solution adopted by the healthcare company has allowed for large savings in terms of cost containment and the traceability of drugs.",Lecture Notes in Information Systems and Organisation,01/01/2016,10.1007/978-3-319-28907-6_5,1
A hierarchical decomposition framework for modeling combinatorial optimization problems,"Complex Optimization Problems has existed in many fields of science, including economics, healthcare, logistics and finance where a complex problem has to be solved. Thus, modeling a complex problem is a fundamental step to relax its complexity and achieve to a final solution of the master problem. Hierarchical optimization is a main step in optimization problems handling process. It consists of decomposing an optimization problem into two or more sub-problems; each sub-problem has its own objectives and constraints. It will help to prove the correct understanding and represent the problem in a different form that facilitates its solving. In this work, we stipulate that a hierarchical decomposition of complex problems can yield to more effective solutions. The proposed framework will contain four possible strategies which will be detailed through this paper; objective based decomposition; constraints based decomposition, semantic decomposition and data partitioning strategy. Each strategy will be argued by a set of examples from the literature to validate our framework. However, some conditions shall be verified to model the problem using such conditions are problems' characteristics that will help to identify if a combinatorial optimization problem can be modeled within the proposed framework and they are detailed in the following subsections.",Procedia Computer Science,01/01/2015,10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.169,1
Methods and concepts for elaborating a decision aided tool for optimizing healthcare medicines dispatching flows,"Globalization and new technologies are causes of the development of industry 4.0 concepts. Nowadays, Industry is becoming increasingly technological, machines are reaching spaces previously destined in factories to humans. Indeed, industry 4.0 concepts based on scientific, technological, and organizational concepts & tools (Internet of thing, RFID, Cobots, decision aided tools) and including sustainability could be used in different activity sectors. Healthcare sector is being transformed by new technologies and complex problems of this sector are solved by insisting on new technological parameters. FEI and Icam engineering schools are collaborating on healthcare logistics & transport area. The idea is to use the previous approach being elaborated for industrial companies to improve healthcare logistics and transport domain (Healthcare logistics 4.0). This paper presents concepts and tools (healthcare logistics 4.0) for solving real healthcare logistics problems. The approach elaborated is hybrid (combination of experimentation for acquiring real data and design for elaborating concepts and methods required for developing an adapted problem-solving tool). The decision aided tool is elaborated by using formalisms of artificial intelligence (such as expert systems, machine learning, multi-agent systems) in order to optimize medicine dispatching flows in a hospital. After describing healthcare logistics dispatching problems, a literature review will be presented for choosing concepts and formalisms that could be for developing the new decisional tool. Then, an example will be given for illustrating concepts elaborated.",Procedia Manufacturing,01/01/2019,10.1016/j.promfg.2020.01.028,0
Handling uncertainty in the specification of autonomous multi-robot systems through mission adaptation,"Multi-robot systems (MRS) have gained interest as a versatile paradigm for complex task execution across various domains such as healthcare, logistics, and maintenance. Often, they are called to operate in variable and dynamic environments, which makes uncertainties arise and affect those systems. Uncertainties require the system to be able to adapt its behavior at runtime, in response to the changing and unpredictable conditions in its operating environment. Moreover, often the behavior of the robots cannot be completely anticipated at design time. Consequently, static mission planning is not always suitable: mission specifications need to take into account the uncertainties and, hence, be dynamic and re-configurable at runtime, when the required knowledge is available.This work focuses on the realization of adaptable multi-robot systems, which are capable of dealing with uncertainties by adapting their mission at runtime. We introduce the concept of ""adaptable task"" that is used in the global mission specification of the MRS to identify the mission tasks affected by uncertainties. Adaptation alternatives are modeled as sub-missions and associated with the adaptable task. At runtime, ad hoc written ""trigger functions"" executed by robots sense and evaluate the environment and select the most suitable adaptation alternative to be executed.We have experimented with the approach by simulating a use case to assess its validity. The system was able to adapt its behavior in response to the environmental conditions, thus allowing the fulfillment of the mission goals. We also discuss the applicability of the use case on a set of known single- and multi-robot systems.","Proceedings - 2024 IEEE/ACM 19th Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems, SEAMS 2024",15/04/2024,10.1145/3643915.3644099,0
The COVID-19 pandemic and follow-up for shoulder surgery: The impact of a shift toward telemedicine on validated patient-reported outcomes,"Introduction: The emergence of COVID-19 and its ensuing restrictions on in-person healthcare has resulted in a sudden shift towards the utilization of telemedicine. The purpose of this study is to assess patient satisfaction and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for individuals who underwent follow-up for shoulder surgery using telemedicine compared to those who received traditional in-person clinic follow-up. Methods: Patients who underwent either rotator cuff repair or total shoulder arthroplasty during a designated pre-COVID-19 (traditional clinic follow-up) or peri-COVID-19 (telemedicine follow-up) span of time were identified. PROMs including the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons standardized assessment form, the three-level version of the EQ-5D form, the 12-Item Short Form survey, and a modified version of a published telemedicine survey were administered to participants six months post-operatively via phone call. Results: Sixty patients agreed to participate. There was no significant difference between the pre-COVID-19 and peri-COVID-19 groups in patient satisfaction with their follow-up visit (p = 0.289), nor was there a significant difference in PROMs between the two groups. In total, 83.33% of the telemedicine group and 70.37% of the in-person clinic group preferred traditional in-person follow-up over telemedicine. Discussion: In a cohort of patients who underwent telemedicine follow-up for shoulder surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no difference in patient satisfaction and PROMs compared to traditional in-person clinic follow-up. This study indicates that while the majority of participants preferred face-to-face visits, patients were relatively satisfied with their care and had similar functional outcome scores in both groups, despite the large disruption in healthcare logistics caused by COVID-19.",Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare,01/07/2023,10.1177/1357633X21990997,1
Interoperable permissioned-blockchain with sustainable performance,"Bitcoin is an innovative and path-breaking technology that has influenced numerous industries across the globe. It is a form of digital currency (cryptocurrency) that can be used for trading and has the potential to replace fiat money, where the underlying infrastructure is called Blockchain. The Blockchain is an open ledger that provides decentralization, transparency, immutability, and confidentiality. Blockchain can be used in enormous applications, such as healthcare, logistics, supply chain management, the IoT, and so forth. Most of the industrial applications rely on the permissioned blockchain. However, the permissioned blockchain fails in some aspects, such as interoperability among different platforms. This paper suggests a sustainable system to solve the interoperability issue of the permissioned blockchain by designing a new infrastructure. This work has been tested in ethereum and hyperledger frameworks, which obtained a success rate of 100 percent.",Sustainability (Switzerland),01/10/2021,10.3390/su132011132,0
Tailoring LTE-advanced for M2M communication using wireless inband relay node,"Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication is one of the newest research fields today and is expected to play a vital role in business areas such as e-healthcare, logistics etc. Mobile communication standards, such as Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) are designed to provide high data rate and broadband services to human-based communication. However, the nature of M2M traffic is different as terminals usually have to transmit small amounts of data infrequently. In this paper, we evaluate an LTE-A Relay Node (RN) based solution to integrate M2M devices into mobile cellular networks. We develop an M2M scenario consisting of both e-healthcare and logistic devices along with normal LTE-A users in our simulation model using OPNET modeler. The simulation results indicate the better performance of LTE-A network if RN is used for the multiplexing and aggregation of M2M data traffic.","Proceedings of World Telecommunications Congress 2014, WTC 2014",01/01/2014,,0
Managing financial risk in a clinical setting utilizing system dynamics,"Healthcare is a major topic of concern in the United States, and awareness of the difficulties facing the industry has risen in recent years. All of this attention to healthcare has captured the eye of the industrial engineering research community, and research in the field is growing rapidly. An example is the Center for Innovation in Healthcare Logistics at the University of Arkansas, an industrial engineering research center. The healthcare industry presents multiple opportunities for applications of traditional industrial engineering and engineering management methods capable of providing opportunities for enhancing the performance of healthcare organizations. In this presentation, the system dynamics simulation approach is applied to the financial operations of a healthcare clinic in order to explore potential effects of decisions and policies enacted by management at the clinic regarding staffing, reimbursement, and government interactions. The ramifications of various policies will be discussed in the vein of risk management to demonstrate the potential benefits gained from applying the system dynamics approach to healthcare organizations.

A systematic literature review of simulation models for non-technical skill training in healthcare logistics,"Background: Resource allocation in patient care relies heavily on individual judgements of healthcare professionals. Such professionals perform coordinating functions by managing the timing and execution of a multitude of care processes for multiple patients. Based on advances in simulation, new technologies that could be used for establishing realistic representations have been developed. These simulations can be used to facilitate understanding of various situations, coordination training and education in logistics, decision-making processes, and design aspects of the healthcare system. However, no study in the literature has synthesized the types of simulations models available for non-technical skills training and coordination of care. Methods: A systematic literature review, following the PRISMA guidelines, was performed to identify simulation models that could be used for training individuals in operative logistical coordination that occurs on a daily basis. This article reviewed papers of simulation in healthcare logistics presented in the Web of Science Core Collections, ACM digital library, and JSTOR databases. We conducted a screening process to gather relevant papers as the knowledge foundation of our literature study. The screening process involved a query-based identification of papers and an assessment of relevance and quality. Results: Two hundred ninety-four papers met the inclusion criteria. The review showed that different types of simulation models can be used for constructing scenarios for addressing different types of problems, primarily for training and education sessions. The papers identified were classified according to their utilized paradigm and focus areas. (1) Discrete-event simulation in single-category and single-unit scenarios formed the most dominant approach to developing healthcare simulations and dominated all other categories by a large margin. (2) As we approached a systems perspective (cross-departmental and cross-institutional), discrete-event simulation became less popular and is complemented by system dynamics or hybrid modeling. (3) Agent-based simulations and participatory simulations have increased in absolute terms, but the share of these modeling techniques among all simulations in this field remains low. Conclusions: An extensive study analyzing the literature on simulation in healthcare logistics indicates a growth in the number of examples demonstrating how simulation can be used in healthcare settings. Results show that the majority of studies create situations in which non-technical skills of managers, coordinators, and decision makers can be trained. However, more system-level and complex system-based approaches are limited and use methods other than discrete-event simulation.",Advances in Simulation,01/12/2018,10.1186/s41077-018-0072-7,0
Iterative matheuristic for the biomedical sample transportation problem,"This paper proposes an iterative matheuristic for solving the biomedical sample transportation problem (BSTP), which is a routing problem with multiple and interdependent visits in the context of healthcare services. In this problem, the biomedical samples are collected from individuals at a set of healthcare or specimen collection centers and must be transported to designated laboratories to be analyzed. The perishable nature of the specimens forces to visit the collection centers more than once a day to ensure that the time from the moment they are drawn to the arrival at the laboratory do not exceed the samples lifespan. Also, a visit to one center imposes (1) a limit on the duration of the route that transports its samples to the laboratory, and (2) a limit on the latest time at which the same center must be visited again, creating an interdependency between visits, routes and the decision concerning the centers’ opening times. This paper first proposes a mathematical formulation to model the BSTP. Since this formulation is not able to solve medium or large sized instances efficiently, it also proposes an iterative matheuristic, which includes two main steps. The first step produces an approximated solution to the BSTP by a decomposition approach that splits the problem into a series of smaller subproblems that are solved by the proposed mathematical formulation. In the second step, two fix-&-optimize strategies are used with the mathematical formulation to perform a local search around the solutions produced by the decomposition method. The matheuristic has demonstrated its efficiency solving a rich set of real-life instances corresponding to the needs of several regions in the province of Quebec, Canada, in a fraction of the time required to solve the exact mathematical formulation.",Computers and Industrial Engineering,01/06/2024,10.1016/j.cie.2024.110196,1
Mapping the supply chain of anti-malarial drugs in Sub-Saharan African countries,"With malaria emerging as one of the deadliest infectious diseases for young children and women in Sub-Saharan African countries, a growing number of healthcare organisations and government authorities have increased their relentless efforts to control malaria epidemics in Africa. One of the causes for malaria epidemics is the lack of accessibility to anti-malarial drugs that results from archaic logistics infrastructure, inefficient distribution channels and disruptive black markets in Africa. This paper identifies factors that either enhance or hinder the accessibility of anti-malarial drugs to African population sectors vulnerable to malaria epidemics. In addition, it develops a comprehensive supply chain map that reveals the labyrinths of the African logistics infrastructure, distribution channels, government regulations and business customs. Based on this supply chain map, this paper proposes various supply chain strategies that improve the access of anti-malarial drugs and reduce the possibility of drug supply chain disruptions. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",International Journal of Logistics Systems and Management,27/02/2012,10.1504/IJLSM.2012.044047,1
The future of asset management,"Deming was famous for asking people, ""By What Method?"" an objective would be accomplished. Any useful concept has embedded in it the answer to that question. Asset management, to be a valuable concept, must demonstrate a method that leads to success. The method should be inclusive of all the necessary elements, yet be simple to understand. We present a broader view of asset management here, built upon three core operating functions: Lead, Execute and Enable. The execute function is always performed in the plant environment. Manufacturing success is relative to the competition however. Whoever can make the best products at the lowest cost will win. Lead and enable are the great determinants of that relative success. In addition, physical asset management has an identity crisis. Most practitioners use the term synonymously with the maintenance function. Asset Management's opportunity, however, goes beyond maintenance to be a guiding principal for all of manufacturing. This paper explores the four integrated facets of the Execute function in the plant: Capacity acquisition and disposition Production Asset Healthcare Logistics Our model, then, represents the future of asset management, suggesting ""The Method"", necessary elements for successful manufacturing.",TAPPI Fall Technical Conference,01/12/2004,,0
Transportation-Induced Carbon Emissions Jeopardize Healthcare Logistics Sustainability: Toward a Healthier Today and a Better Tomorrow,"Background: Logistics operations are considered essential for transporting commodities from one location to another, helping to promote global economic activity. On the other hand, its negative impact eclipses its positive impact, namely the rise in healthcare expenditures due to its ecological footprint. Globally, rising out-of-pocket health expenses result from logistic-induced carbon emissions, posing a danger to the long-term viability of healthcare. Methods: Based on this critical fact, this study examined the impact of logistics operations on healthcare costs by controlling for carbon emissions, fuel imports, and economic development across a large cross-section of 131 nations by using the Robust Least Squares Regression. Results: The findings demonstrate a U-shaped association between logistical operations and healthcare expenditures, i.e., if there is a 1% increase in logistics operations, healthcare expenditures decrease by −2.421% initially, while at later stages, healthcare costs would increase by 0.139%. On the other hand, increased fuel imports and economic growth due to logistics activities are increasing healthcare expenditures with an elasticity estimate of 0.087% and 0.147%, respectively. According to the forecasting predictions, logistics-induced carbon emissions, fuel imports, and economic expansion will increase healthcare expenses. Conclusions: A sustainable logistics operation is critical for strengthening healthcare infrastructure and meeting the global carbon neutrality goal.",Logistics,01/06/2022,10.3390/logistics6020027,1
Simulation optimization for the inventory management of healthcare supplies,"This article covers the inventory management of healthcare supplies problem. Based on the mathematical programming model set out by [1], a causal model and a flow chart were developed to outline the simulation model, which was to be later applied to a highly specialized medical institution that performs high-risk heart surgery, such as catheterizations and angioplasties. With this simulation model, a purchases plan with 21 healthcare supplies was obtained that contemplates all the problem’s restrictions: purchasing policy (safety stock, available budget); the warehouse’s physical reality (warehouse capacity); characteristics of supplies (useful life, service level); and suppliers (price, capacity and size of lots or rounding value). Different indicators were also considered, such as service levels, costs of purchases, stockouts costs and inventory maintenance costs. The results obtained with the simulation model came very close to the mathematical programming results, but the computing times were considerably shorter.",International Journal of Simulation Modelling,01/06/2020,10.2507/IJSIMM19-2-514,1
Implementation of a new echocardiographic practice during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Due to the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, healthcare logistics have changed abruptly and significantly in all medical specialties, of which cardiovascular services are no exception. Assessment of urgent and priority cases did not stop, both medical personnel and patients required adaptation of personal protective measures to prevent the spread of a highly contagious and potentially fatal virus for this vulnerable population with cardiovascular disease. In the time that has elapsed since the beginning of said pandemic to date, the health sector has become immersed in a fortuitous and challenging situation for its work environment. Considering that this virus could remain endemic, it is necessary to devise a protocol for a gradual and safe reincorporation of services at all levels of care. This document provides an update on recommendations for the return to a safe but no less efficient echocardiographic practice, based on expert opinions, some international guidelines along with evidence available until recently on several main echocardiographic findings in patients with cardiovascular disease by COVID-19, providing a general approach that can be adapted to the guidelines of each health institution in this country.",Cardiovascular and Metabolic Science,01/10/2020,10.35366/97548,1
The Metaheuristic Optimization Techniques in Text Classification,"Metaheuristic algorithms, inspired by natural phenomena and human-based strategies, offer versatile approaches to navigate diverse search spaces and adapt to dynamic environments. These algorithms, including evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, bio-inspired methods, human-based approaches, and plant-inspired techniques, have found applications across diverse domains such as engineering, finance, healthcare, logistics, and telecommunications. In the text classification domain, metaheuristic techniques have emerged as powerful tools to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of classification systems. By optimizing feature subsets, fine-tuning model parameters, and addressing challenges such as feature selection, dimensionality reduction, class imbalance, and noisy data, metaheuristic algorithms provide flexible solutions that adapt to various text datasets and tasks. This review paper comprehensively explores recent advancements in metaheuristic applications in text classification across six categories. From evolutionary-based methods to swarm-based approaches, bio-inspired techniques to physics/chemistry-based strategies, human-based methods to plant-based algorithms, researchers have leveraged diverse metaheuristic techniques to push the boundaries of text classification.

Impacts of Losses Functions on the Quality of the Ultrasound Image by Using Machine Learning Algorithms,"During last decade, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been able to reshape our life daily. Different areas were positively impacted by AI such as Healthcare, Logistic, etc. Medical imaging is one of the fields of healthcare in which AI was introduced to solve and overcome different problems. Challenges including image processing, signal processing, and data acquisition. In this paper, we deeply demonstrate the loss function as one of the main parameters that influence the quality of the ultrasound (US) image. Therefore, we introduce the main components of ultrasound systems form end-to-end perspective such as the data acquisition, the signal processing, and the image interpretation. Then, we present the losses functions as a critical performance metrics for the model validation. Metrics such as the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Cross-Entropy loss function (CE), Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), and the Structural Similarity (SSIM). After that we present the adopted CNN model to generate ultrasound image. The excessive simulation results demonstrate that the selection of the loss function provides significant improvement in terms of image quality (e.g., contrast, CNR and SNR). Choosing simple loss functions such as mean square error helps to faster the convergence of the convolution neural network during the training process. However, for image quality enhancement, we propose the combination of different loss functions such structural similarity (SSIM) with Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).","2021 IEEE International Conference on Automatic Control and Intelligent Systems, I2CACIS 2021 - Proceedings",26/06/2021,10.1109/I2CACIS52118.2021.9495878,1

Multicommodity flows and Benders decomposition for restricted continuous location problems,"The restricted continuous facility location problem arises when there is a need to locate a number of facilities to serve a discrete set of demand points, and where the location of a facility can be anywhere on the plane except for in restricted regions. The problem finds applications in urban planning, disaster management, and healthcare logistics. The restricted regions can occur randomly or are known in advance. The paper describes a new model for the problem that is based on multicommodity flows with unknown destinations and defined on a discretization of the plane. The model and discretization are applied to both the deterministic and the stochastic continuous restricted location problem, where the latter is converted into a deterministic equivalent problem by minimizing the expected value of the objective function weighted by the probabilities of scenarios. The paper also describes a Benders decomposition algorithm to optimally solve the model. Extensive computational results are presented on both benchmark instances from the literature and new instances, on both the deterministic and stochastic variant of the problem. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is superior to an off-the-shelf solver in terms of computational time. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the exact algorithm described here is the first to address both the deterministic and the stochastic variants of continuous restricted location problems with any number of facilities.",European Journal of Operational Research,01/05/2018,10.1016/j.ejor.2017.11.033,0
Evaluating Replenishment Systems for Disposable Supplies at the Operating Theater: A Simulation Case Study,"Ensuring cost containment while providing high quality patient care is of paramount concern to hospitals. The operating theater in particular is a major cost driver for any hospital, and is among the most critical resources in terms of both capacity and patient care. Effective inventory and distribution systems are a prerequisite for realizing efficiency improvements in the internal operating theater supply chain. In this work, discrete-event simulation is used to model part of the internal distribution process in the operating theater at a Belgian Hospital and to identify improvements by focusing on the replenishment process. A logistics performance measurement framework based on Analytic Network Process (ANP), as a popular Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique, is adopted to assess three replenishment scenarios. The best performing scenario is selected using the Internal Logistics Efficiency Performance (ILEP) index as an evaluation basis.

Healthcare logistics &amp; supply chain management in health industry of Indonesia based on the telemedicine,"The essential mission of logistics and supply chain management is to efficiently plan, organize, and coordinate the movement of goods from a point of origin to a point of consumption. Analyzing and aligning supply chain goals with a patient-first approach enables healthcare organizations to reduce costs while improving patient outcomes. With Patient Direct, a care delivery solution from HRS, this paper provides patients with the telehealth equipment they need when they need it by telemedicine. Telemedicine which is used interchangeably with the term telehealth is the remote delivery of healthcare to patients through information and communication technology, including communication between two or more health professionals who are not in the same location. Thus, it needs secure transmission of medical data through text, sound, image, or video. This system can be a tele-education, tele-monitoring, tele-consultation, or tele-intervention. Telemedicine has several benefits, both for health professionals and medical institution as well as for the patients, especially for the development of healthcare delivery in remote area and also to make interaction between healthcare professional faster. However, telemedicine still has lack of regulation in Indonesia. There is still no regulation about license for the health professional and safety of medical data. Ethical problems in telemedicine are also still an issue, especially about patient's confidentiality, and also it can weaken doctor-patients relationship. According code of ethics, a doctor must examine the patients first before making a diagnosis and treatment, which cannot be done with telemedicine. The lack of regulation and ethical consideration make telemedicine in Indonesia still has some problems and need a challenge for improvement.",International Journal of Supply Chain Management,01/01/2020,,1
Sustainable supply chain management practices and sustainable performance in hospitals: A systematic review and integrative framework,"Hospital supply chains are responsible for several economic inefficiencies, negative environmental impacts, and social concerns. However, a lack of research on sustainable supply chain management specific to this sector is identified. Existing studies do not analyze supply chain management practices in an integrated and detailed manner, and do not consider all sustainable performance dimensions. To address these gaps, this paper presents a systematic literature review and develops a framework for identifying the supply chain management practices that may contribute to sustainable performance in hospitals. The proposed framework is composed of 12 categories of management practices, which include strategic management and leadership, supplier management, purchasing, warehousing and inventory, transportation and distribution, information and technology, energy, water, food, hospital design, waste, and customer relationship management. On the other side, performance categories include economic, environmental, and social factors. Moreover, illustrative effects of practices on performance are discussed. The novelty of this document lies in its focus on hospital settings, as well as on its comprehensiveness regarding the operationalization of practices and performance dimensions. In addition, a future research agenda is provided, which emphasizes the need for improved research generalizability, empirical validation, integrative addressing, and deeper analysis of relationships between practices and performance.",Sustainability (Switzerland),01/11/2019,10.3390/su11215949,1
Artificial Intelligence for Healthcare Logistics: An Overview and Research Agenda,"In this chapter we present the existing literature on machine learning approaches and artificial intelligence for logistical problems arising for designing, providing and improving healthcare services. As a basis, we provide a framework for the classification of artificial intelligence. For the analysis, we distinguish between the care levels (primary, secondary and tertiary care), the planning levels (strategic, tactical and operational), as well as the user types (doctors, nurses, technicians, patients, etc.). Based on the results, we provide a research agenda with open topics and future challenges.",Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining in Healthcare,01/01/2021,10.1007/978-3-030-45240-7_1,1
An efficient adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm based on heuristics and reformulations for the generalized quadratic assignment problem,"Operations Research (OR) analytics play a crucial role in optimizing decision-making processes for real-world problems. The assignment problem, with applications in supply chains, healthcare logistics, and production scheduling, represents a prominent optimization challenge. This paper focuses on addressing the Generalized Quadratic Assignment Problem (GQAP), a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. To tackle the GQAP, we propose an OR analytical approach that incorporates efficient relaxations, reformulations, heuristics, and a metaheuristic algorithm. Initially, we employ the Reformulation Linearization Technique (RLT) to generate various linear relaxation models, carefully selecting the most efficient ones. Building upon this foundation, we introduce a robust reformulation based on Benders Decomposition (BD), which serves as the basis for an iterative optimization algorithm applied to the GQAP. Furthermore, we develop a constructive heuristic algorithm to identify near-optimal solutions, followed by an enhancement utilizing an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) metaheuristic algorithm. This ALNS algorithm is enhanced through the integration of a tabu list derived from Tabu Search (TS) and a decision rule inspired by Simulated Annealing (SA). To validate our approach and evaluate its performance, we conduct a comparative analysis against state-of-the-art algorithms documented in the literature. This comparison confirms the significant improvements achieved in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency through our proposed methodology. These advancements contribute to the state of the art in solving the GQAP and hold the potential to enhance decision-making processes in a wide range of domains. Our methodology demonstrates remarkable improvements in solution quality and computational efficiency when compared to existing approaches, as evidenced by the comparative results with state-of-the-art algorithms. The potential implications of our research extend to optimizing decision-making processes in diverse fields, rendering it highly relevant and impactful.",Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,01/11/2023,10.1016/j.engappai.2023.106802,1
Simheuristic and learnheuristic algorithms for the temporary-facility location and queuing problem during population treatment or testing events,"Epidemic outbreaks, such as the one generated by the coronavirus disease, have raised the need for more efficient healthcare logistics. One of the challenges that many governments have to face in such scenarios is the deployment of temporary medical facilities across a region with the purpose of providing medical services to their citizens. This work tackles this temporary-facility location and queuing problem with the goals of minimising costs, the expected completion time, population travel time, and waiting time. The completion time for a facility depends on the numbers assigned to those facilities as well as stochastic arrival times. This work proposes a learnheuristic algorithm to solve the facility location and population assignment problem. Firstly a machine learning algorithm is trained using data from a queuing model (simulation module). The learnheuristic then constructs solutions using the machine learning algorithm to rapidly evaluate decisions in terms of facility completion and population waiting times. The efficiency and quality of the algorithm is demonstrated by comparison with exact and simulation-only (simheuristic) methodologies. A series of experiments are performed which explore the trade-offs between solution cost, completion time, population travel time, and waiting time.",Journal of Simulation,01/01/2023,10.1080/17477778.2023.2166879,0
Six Sigma and Lean in healthcare logistics centre design and operation: A case at North Mississippi Health Services,"This paper presents a case study of applying the principles and procedures of Six Sigma and Lean Thinking in designing and operating a healthcare logistics centre. The customer needs were identified from the viewpoint of patients and four critical-to-quality parameters were defined as the fill rate, accuracy rate, efficiency and expiration/ spoilage rates. Based on the identified core and value-adding steps, the centre layout was designed and 11 initiatives were implemented to improve the critical-to-quality parameters. The project resulted in better storage management, better use of space, an improved and cleaner workspace, more timely and efficient delivery of the right items with the right amount to the right patients and tracking and reducing waste. The logistics centre is currently running in a lean way, in the sense of the same amount of staff, more items to patients, and an $800,000 annual saving. © 2008, Inderscience Publishers.",International Journal of Six Sigma and Competitive Advantage,01/01/2008,10.1504/IJSSCA.2008.021840,1
Insights before flights: How community perceptions can make or break medical drone deliveries,"Drones are increasingly used to transport health products, but life-saving interventions can be stalled if local community concerns and preferences are not assessed and addressed. In order to inform the introduction of drones in new contexts, this paper analyzed similarities and differences in community perceptions of medical delivery drones in Malawi, Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Dominican Republic (DR). Community perceptions were assessed using focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) conducted with stakeholders at the national level, at health facilities and in communities. Data were collected on respondents’ familiarity with drones, perceptions of benefits and risks of drones, advice on drone operations and recommendations on sharing information with the community. The comparative analysis found similar perceptions around the potential benefits of using drones, as well as important differences in the perceived risks of flying drones and culturally appropriate communication mechanisms based on the local context. Because community perceptions are heavily influenced by culture and local experiences, a similar assessment should be conducted before introducing drone activities in new areas and two-way feedback channels should be established once drone operations are established in an area. The extent to which a community understands and supports the use of drones to transport health products will ultimately play a critical role in the success or failure of the drone’s ability to bring life-saving products to those who need them.",Drones,01/09/2020,10.3390/drones4030051,1
Real-time management of intra-hospital patient transport requests,"This paper addresses the management of patients’ transportation requests within a hospital, a very challenging problem where requests must be scheduled among the available porters so that patients arrive at their destination timely and the resources invested in patient transport are kept as low as possible. Transportation requests arrive during the day in an unpredictable manner, so they need to be scheduled in real-time. To ensure that the requests are scheduled in the best possible manner, one should also reconsider the decisions made on pending requests that have not yet been completed, a process that will be referred to as rescheduling. This paper proposes several policies to trigger and execute the rescheduling of pending requests and three approaches (a mathematical formulation, a constructive heuristic, and a local search heuristic) to solve each rescheduling problem. A simulation tool is proposed to assess the performance of the rescheduling strategies and the proposed scheduling methods to tackle instances inspired by a real mid-size hospital. Compared to a heuristic that mimics the way requests are currently handled in our partner hospital, the best combination of scheduling method and rescheduling strategy produces an average 5.7 minutes reduction in response time and a 13% reduction in the percentage of late requests. Furthermore, since the total distance walked by porters is substantially reduced, our experiments demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the number of porters – and therefore the operating costs – without reducing the current level of service.",Health Care Management Science,01/01/2024,10.1007/s10729-024-09667-6,1
Outsourcing strategies and distribution models in Italian Pharma Supply Chain,"In the pharmaceutical supply chain, all players have to ensure the highest level of service while containing costs, because of the ethical issues concerning drugs. The outsourcing of logistics should be recognized as a competitive lever, especially in this complex and highly regulated industry. Based on these premises, the research objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between the outsourcing strategies of manufacturers and the logistics services offered by Third-Party Logistics Service providers (3PLs). To achieve this objective, a multiple case study was designed to analyse the different physical distribution models adopted by pharmaceutical companies. We collected qualitative data and the subjective perceptions of several logistics directors, conducting structured interviews with 11 pharmaceutical companies and six 3PLs. We have identified three physical distribution models, on the basis of the number and location of the warehouses used (single warehouse, dual warehouse and multi-warehouse models). We discovered that there is a strict relationship between the physical distribution model adopted by pharmaceutical companies and their features (i.e. the main distribution channel, product portfolio, target service level, transport and warehousing costs and other company related issues). Our research also offers an empirical insight into the key logistic services that 3PLs should offer within the pharma industry. In conclusion, the study draws a roadmap to guide pharmaceutical companies in their strategic logistics decisions in Italy, while also considering possible future trends deriving from changes to European regulations.","Proceedings - 2017 IEEE International Conference on Service Operations and Logistics, and Informatics, SOLI 2017",27/11/2017,10.1109/SOLI.2017.8120990,1
DEEP LEARNING FOR THE PREDICTION OF TRANS-BORDER LOGISTICS OF PATIENTS TO MEDICAL CENTERS,"Background: Covid 19 impacted many healthcare logistics systems. An enormous number of people suffer from the effect of a pandemic, infection diseases can spread rapidly within and between countries. People from the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Lao People's Democratic Republic are most likely to cross-border into Thailand for diagnosis and special treatment. In this situation, international referral cannot predict the volume of patients and their destination. Therefore, the aim of the research is to use deep learning to construct a model that predicts the travel demand of patients at the border. Methods: Based on previous emergency medical services, the prediction demand used the gravity model or the regression model. The novelty element in this research paper uses the neural network technique. In this study, a two-stage survey is used to collect data. The first phase interviews experts from the strategic group level of The Public Health Office. The second phase examines the patient?s behavior regarding route selection using a survey. The methodology uses deep learning training using the Sigmoid function and Identity function. The statistics of precision include the average percent relative error (APRE), the root mean square error (RMSE), the standard deviation (SD), and the correlation coefficient (R). Results: Deep learning is suitable for complex problems as a network. The model allows the different data sets to forecast the demand for the cross-border patient for each hospital. Equations are applied to forecast demand, in which the different hospitals require a total of 58,000 patients per year to be diagnosed by the different hospitals. The predictor performs better than the RBF and regression model. Conclusions: The novelty element of this research uses the deep learning technique as an efficient nonlinear model; moreover, it is suitable for dynamic prediction. The main advantage is to apply this model to predict the number of patients, which is the key to determining the supply chain of treatment; additionally, the ability to formulate guidelines with healthcare logistics effectively in the future.",Logforum,01/01/2022,10.17270/J.LOG.2022.689,1
Potential impact of RFID-based tracing systems on the integrity of pharmaceutical products,"Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is going to play a crucial role as auto-identification technology in a wide range of applications such as healthcare, logistics, supply chain management, ticketing, et cetera. The use of electromagnetic waves to identify, trace, and track people or goods allows solving many problems related to auto-identification devices based on optical reading (i.e. bar code). Currently, high interest is concentrated on the use of Radio Frequency (RF) solutions in healthcare and pharmaceutical supply chain, in order to improve drugs flow transparency and patients' safety. Unfortunately, there is a possibility that drug interaction with electromagnetic fields (EMFs) generated by RF devices, such as RFID readers, deteriorate the potency of bioactive compounds. This chapter proposes an experimental multidisciplinary approach to investigate potential alterations induced by EMFs on drug molecular structure and performance. To show the versatility of this approach, some experimental results obtained on two biological pharmaceuticals (peptide hormone-based) are discussed. © 2013, IGI Global.","Advanced RFID Systems, Security, and Applications",01/12/2012,10.4018/978-1-4666-2080-3.ch011,0

A Mobile Healthcare Service Routing and Scheduling Problem in Rural Areas,"A change in health policy become essential since healthcare needs of societies have changed over the past sixty years. It is not possible to build a hospital wherever people live especially in less populated settlements. However, equal access of people to health services must be ensured by governments. To tackle this issue, Turkey Ministry of Health has enforced to give mobile healthcare services in rural areas by approximately 7.5 thousand doctors located in 3.4 thousand medical centers. These doctors work 8 h/day and give mobile healthcare service to approximately 9 million people each month. This study considers Turkey rural healthcare delivery system as a Multi-depot Time Constrained Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem (md-TCPVRP) and presents a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the problem. The goal is to derive daily routes of the doctors each month, under some constraints such as maximum workhours, route duration, minimum service time per visit, assigning dedicated doctors to villages while minimizing the total route distance. In order to investigate the performance of the model a computational experiment is carried. The real-life application of Health Directorate of the province and proposed mathematical model results are compared.

Modelling the growing process of integrated healthcare supply networks,"This work contributes to the practice of healthcare system modelling, by presenting an urgent issue: the growing process of integrated healthcare supply networks in reducing public healthcare systems' annual expenses and improving performance. Various critical aspects affect the strategic design and development of healthcare logistic networks in practice. The conceptual discussion is empirically derived on the basis of the challenge created by the development of centralized healthcare supply networks supported by the implementation of new IT/IS investments and advanced logistic hubs for hospital material inventory management. The study moves towards the development of a newer ""Healthcare Supply Network Causal Loop Diagram,"" to analyse and predict the growth pattern of a healthcare logistic network in its complexity, and understand how well the supply network will fit with the benefit provided by new logistic economies of scale and the risk of failures under uncertainty.","Healthcare Administration: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications",31/08/2014,10.4018/978-1-4666-6339-8.ch019,1
The multi-trip vehicle routing problem with increasing profits for the blood transportation: An iterated local search metaheuristic,"This paper studies a multi-trip routing problem of a shuttle fleet to transport blood units from collection sites to a blood center. In this problem, the blood units intended to produce platelets and cryoprecipitate must be processed within eight hours from their donation and arrive at the blood center at a time less than its closing time to guarantee enough processing time. Since it is assumed that blood units are donated at a collection site following a constant ratio over its operating hours, this problem is modeled as a multi-trip vehicle routing problem with increasing profits for which a mixed-integer linear programming formulation is proposed. A hybrid iterated local search metaheuristic and an extended version are developed as solution methods. The extended version includes a mixed-integer linear programming component into the local search of the hybrid metaheuristic to optimize the decision on the departure times of the trips. The solution methods are tested on a new set of instances based on the blood collection system of Bogota, Colombia.",Computers and Industrial Engineering,01/08/2022,10.1016/j.cie.2022.108294,0

Early Determinants of Length of Hospital Stay: A Case Control Survival Analysis among COVID-19 Patients admitted in a Tertiary Healthcare Facility of East India,"Background: Length of hospital stay (LOS) for a disease is a vital estimate for healthcare logistics planning. The study aimed to illustrate the effect of factors elicited on arrival on LOS of the COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: It was a retrospective, record based, unmatched, case control study using hospital records of 334 COVID-19 patients admitted in an East Indian tertiary healthcare facility during May to October 2020. Discharge from the hospital (cases/survivors) was considered as an event while death (control/non-survivors) as right censoring in the case-control survival analysis using cox proportional hazard model. Results: Overall, we found the median LOS for the survivors to be 8 days [interquartile range (IQR): 7-10 days] while the same for the non-survivors was 6 days [IQR: 2-11 days]. In the multivariable cox-proportional hazard model; travel distance (>16 km) [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 0.69, 95% CI: (0.50-0.95)], mode of transport to the hospital (ambulance) [aHR: 0.62, 95% CI: (0.45-0.85)], breathlessness (yes) [aHR: 0.56, 95% CI: (0.40-0.77)], number of co-morbidities (1-2) [aHR: 0.66, 95% CI: (0.47-0.93)] (≥3) [aHR: 0.16, 95% CI: (0.04-0.65)], COPD/asthma (yes) [[aHR: 0.11, 95% CI: (0.01-0.79)], DBP (<60/≥90) [aHR: 0.55, 95% CI: (0.35-0.86)] and qSOFA score (≥2) [aHR: 0.33, 95% CI: (0.12-0.92)] were the significant attributes affecting LOS of the COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Factors elicited on arrival were found to be significantly associated with LOS. A scoring system inculcating these factors may be developed to predict LOS of the COVID-19 patients.",Journal of Primary Care and Community Health,01/01/2021,10.1177/21501327211054281,0
Coordinating inventory sharing with retailer's return in the consignment contracts,"Hospitals purchase medical supplies from the dealer on consignment contracts. Dealer provides a return policy for unused inventory but charging a return fee. Two hospitals could share inventory which reduces the amount of return to the dealer. Motivated by this consignment contract policy for the medical supply chain, we develop a common dealer and two independent retailers framework that considers retailers' sharing action and return problem. We aim at developing a coordinating mechanism to manage the retailers' sharing and return action that benefits both the dealer and retailers. Dealer-dominated sharing and retailer-dominated sharing are compared from the perspective of sharing performance and expected profits. We also analyse the condition that the dealer is better off from retailers' sharing when the dealer has the power to encourage retailers' sharing, and the dealer's trading preference for a non-cooperative retailer or cooperative retailers when the dealer has no power to encourage retailers' sharing. Numerical experiments are conducted to examine the sensitivity of retailers' sharing decisions, retailers' and dealer's profit to the return price.",International Journal of Production Research,01/01/2022,10.1080/00207543.2020.1854485,0
Investigating the Impact of Drone Transport on the Stability of Monoclonal Antibodies for Inter-Hospital Transportation,"In the field of healthcare logistics, the reliance on conventional transport methods such as cars for the delivery of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is susceptible to challenges posed by traffic and infrastructure, leading to increased and unpredictable transport times. Recognizing the potential role of drones in mitigating these challenges, we aimed to investigate the impact of medical drone transport on the stability of mAbs. Compromised stability could lead to aggregation and immunogenicity, thereby jeopardizing the efficacy and safety of mAbs. We studied the transportation of vials as well as ready-to-administer infusion bags with blinatumomab, tocilizumab, and daratumumab. The methodology involved the measurement of both temperature and mechanical shock during drone transport. Moreover, the analytical techniques High Performance Size-Exclusion Chromatography (HP-SEC), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Light Obscuration (LO), Micro-Flow Imaging (MFI), and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) were employed to comprehensively assess the presence of aggregates and particle formation. The key findings revealed no significant differences between car and drone transport, indicating that the stability of mAbs in both vials and infusion bags was adequately maintained during drone transport. This suggests that medical drones are a viable and reliable means for the inter-hospital transport of mAbs, paving the way for more efficient and predictable logistics in healthcare delivery.",Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences,01/07/2024,10.1016/j.xphs.2024.04.002,1
