Bridging the Performance Gap Between Two-Way and One-Way CSI-Based 5 GHz WiFi Ranging,"Indoor Localization is gaining increased importance due to numerous location-based services in healthcare, logistics, and security, to name few, that are expected to be provided by next-generation wireless networks. Such services are characterized by stringent accuracy requirements, short response time, and lower cost which makes the localization problem more challenging and deserving of attention. A key element of the localization process is distance estimation (also known as ranging). In this paper, we design and analyze an efficient decimeter-level two-way ranging scheme for ubiquitous WiFi networks in the 5 GHz frequency band whose accuracy approaches ideal one-way ranging with no phase mismatches. We investigate the idea of channel frequency response (CFR) stitching across non-contiguous WiFi channels and how two-way CFR measurements help in achieving the CFR coherency necessary for accurate ranging. In addition, we quantify the decrease in ranging accuracy of two-way compared to one-way ranging due to SNR degradation, Line-of-Sight (LoS) component shrinkage, and doubling the multipath delay spread. Furthermore, We design a novel scheme to bridge the performance gap between two-way ranging and ideal one-way ranging which operates in three main steps: square-root of the two-way CFR, followed by phase unwrapping, and finally deep fade detection and phase errors correction. Our proposed scheme achieves significant performance gains over two-way ranging with only a slight performance gap from ideal one-way ranging. Moreover, our proposed scheme enjoys robustness as it preserves the ranging accuracy gains in various WiFi communication scenarios when operating at different SNR levels, different multipath channel models, and different CFR bandwidths, as well as operating under system impairments such as Sample Timing Offset (STO). The accuracy gains achieved by the proposed schemes are demonstrated using both simulations and an in-house WiFi testbed. Finally, we quantify the added complexity of our proposed scheme and show it to be insignificant compared to that of the MUSIC super-resolution ranging steps which confirms the practical viability of our proposed scheme.",IEEE Access,01/01/2023,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3287850,1
A fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis approach for risk evaluation in healthcare logistics outsourcing: Case of Morocco,"Public–private partnerships in emerging countries are gradually considered a tool for growth development. One particular public–private partnership is that of outsourcing logistics in the healthcare sector. These partnerships provide several benefits for both private and public sectors but are generally associated with numerous risks that must be evaluated and subsequently managed. The aim in this paper is to develop a risk evaluation approach to rank risks when decision makers’ judgment is taken into consideration and where traditional risk evaluation techniques become less applicable. The proposed approach makes use of fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis methods since they are efficient techniques to rank alternatives based on selected evaluation criteria and can accommodate human judgment and preferences. The approach treats predetermined risks like alternatives, and evaluation criteria are represented by areas of impact of the risks. To validate the approach, we applied it to a real case of logistics outsourcing to private service providers in a Moroccan public pharmaceutical supply chain. The ranking results obtained show that the two methods lead to some differences in ranking but are highly correlated. The obtained results support healthcare policy makers in setting priorities to effectively deploy preventive and mitigation efforts.",Health Services Management Research,01/08/2020,10.1177/0951484820901668,0
Enabling process support for advanced applications with the aristaflow BPM suite,"A process-aware information system (PAIS) will be not accepted by end users if its software clients do not support their native workows or are too complex for them. When implementing business processes based on process management technology important issues are, therefore, how end-users can participate in the execution of the processes and how this can be accomplished as intuitively as possible. This becomes extremely important if high exibility demands need to be fulfilled during process execution, while PAIS robustness and error safety need to be assured. In this software demonstration we show how the AristaFlow BPM Suite { an adaptive process management system developed by us { was applied to challenging applications in domains like healthcare, logistics, disaster management, and software development. The implementation of adaptive software clients in these different applications particularly proves the benefits provided by an open application programming interface (API) as offered by AristaFlow.",CEUR Workshop Proceedings,01/12/2010,,1
Intellectual property issues in artificial intelligence: Specific reference to the service sector,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed almost every field of the service sector, such as finance, healthcare logistics, automotive and aviation. The innovative technologies can identify uneven patterns like spam filtering or payment deceit, and make aware businesses in actual time about questionable activities, hence are helpful in the growth of a market. These innovation and creation are protected under different forms of intellectual property (IP). However, the transformation from AI related inventions to AI lead inventions has raised substantial challenges to the existing IP infrastructure. This study aims at looking into different aspects of AI related IP protection with an elaborative analysis of the patenting trends through landscape analysis of AI in the service sector. It is observed that AI is playing a pivotal role in the transformation of the service sector due to its accelerating use. But the issues related to legal and ethical need to be addressed for effective utilisation of AI related invention and creation in the service sector.","International Journal of Technological Learning, Innovation and Development",01/01/2021,10.1504/IJTLID.2021.114920,1
From network approach to ecosystem approach: A new framework for change management,"The actual change management models drawn from literature are focused only on the perspective of a single organisation. This perspective is not coherent with the new business scenario created by the pervasive use of digital technologies, which requires a new way to deal with organizational change. In particular, organizations have to manage change in a collaborative way, reflecting a progressive shift from a network to an ecosystem approach. Starting from this perspective, this paper aim to present a change on management framework in order to manage innovation within a complex digital ecosystem of actors. Coherently with this goal, the proposed framework will be articulated in a series of phases that have to be considered in the change process within an ecosystem. For each phase, the research will present the most common issues faced by organizations together with the corresponding change management actions. These actions are categorized in short-term and long-term. Moreover, the paper provides a set of indicators that can be used to monitor the effectiveness of the various change management actions. Finally, the validity of the change management framework will be proved thanks to its application in a project of digital innovation in healthcare domain. This analysis will provide a concrete example on how change management can be accomplished throughout a specific digital ecosystem.","Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",01/01/2021,10.34190/EIE.21.077,1

L'impartition des activités logistiques dans le secteur de la santé: les leçons d'une expérience canadienne,"Logistics activities are seen by many healthcare organizations as an opportunity for financial savings. The level of logistics complexity in these organizations may explain the challenges they face in applying solutions common in other industries. This case study of a medical-supply distribution outsourcing initiative to a logistics services provider by a group of hospitals in a region of Canada helps elucidate this complexity. The objective of this article is to identify the dissonances between various points of view in order to articulate lessons for managers while taking into account the specifics of the healthcare sector. By examining information from several sources, this study shows the necessity of: 1) setting objectives and managing expectations in order to maintain the interest and participation of stakeholders throughout the project; 2) updating internal logistics processes prior to outsourcing; 3) carefully considering a gradual transition phase by ensuring short-term benefits for both partners; 4) requiring problem-solving skills as a selection criterion for the logistics services provider to ensure continuous improvement in the performance of the outsourced activity; and 5) developing a governance accountability framework to support problem solving between all parties involved.

Paving the way for warehouse centralization in healthcare: A preliminary assessment approach,"Centralized logistics management is currently one interesting option for healthcare systems facing an increasing need to improve responsiveness and service quality while reducing costs. This work focuses on one aspect of centralized logistics, namely warehouse centralization and proposes a preliminary approach to assess material management in healthcare institutions as a first step towards decisions about the implementation of such a strategy. A list of variables and relationships between them characterizing warehouse material management are identified based on a literature review and knowledge of real logistics processes. Statistical analysis is then applied to assess the existence of such relationships in a set of healthcare organizations in order to understand the management commonalities that can stimulate warehouse centralization as well as the criticalities that could potentially hinder it. The approach is tested in a healthcare logistics system in Northern Italy. The results proved the ability of the methodology to identify the relevant issues the involved institutions need to work on when undertaking warehouse centralization strategies. The case warehouses revealed a good degree of commonalities in their management practices although three critical aspects were identified, namely a limited efficiency in human resource allocation, a high fragmentation of stock product demand and a relevant number of stock products with low annual demand. This work provides a methodology to increase material managers’ awareness about the factors enabling successful centralized inventory strategies in the healthcare sector.",American Journal of Applied Sciences,05/05/2016,10.3844/ajassp.2016.490.500,1
Revolutionizing healthcare 5.0: Blockchain-driven optimization of drone-to-everything communication using 5G network for enhanced medical services,"The healthcare industry has witnessed a notable surge in the adoption of drone technology for the swift and efficient transportation of vital medical supplies. In the expansive and uncontrolled realm where drones operate, challenges arise concerning authentication and secure data sharing. In the era of Healthcare 5.0, characterized by the integration of cutting-edge technologies, this article explores a groundbreaking approach to revolutionize medical services through the synergy of blockchain technology, drone-to-everything (D2X) communication, and the upcoming 5G network that provides enhanced broadband, extra reliable, low latency communication and massive machine type communication. This research addresses the critical task of delivering medical supplies using drone technology, focusing on ensuring the security, reliability and demand for a large storage capacity during the transportation of sensitive items. This research introduces an optimized communication link by using a blockchain network and the Internet of Things (IoT). To achieve such a goal two different algorithms are introduced and three different scenarios are implemented to include all possibilities in real applications. Three potential routes for data transmission, drone to drone, drone to ground user devices, and drone to base station, are explored to enhance communication efficiency. The contribution lies in optimizing the communication link to ensure a low bit error rate (BER), high signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR) and maintain fixed signal power during data transmission. The outcomes of this study have significant implications for advancing healthcare logistics through the integration of cutting-edge technologies. The performance of the proposed method has been proven by simulations using parametric measurements.",Technology in Society,01/06/2024,10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102552,0
Using lean manufacturing and machine learning for improving medicines procurement and dispatching in a hospital,"Industry 4.0 concepts are defined around the use of new technologies for improving industrial companies according to scientific, technological and organizational aspects. Enterprise complex problems could be solved in this frame. Many methods and concepts presented in the literature are focused on these aspects. A new method is being developed in Icam Paris-Sénart around the idea that sustainability must be the kernel of “industry of the future”. Indeed, the framework proposed is a combination of the previous aspects with environmental, social and societal aspects. The actual situation of the planet is an encouragement to make all future transformations with sustainability as kernel. These concepts could be imported in healthcare logistics and transport area for solving specific problems of this domain. Icam (French Engineer school) and FEI University are collaborating for proposing to healthcare hospitals a new framework (healthcare logistics 4.0) for solving complex problems of this domain. This paper is focusing on how to improve medicines procurement and dispatching in a hospital. Indeed, the use of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare sector is growing up. Data treated and analyzed could give important insights for solving problems and improving the existing organization. As machine learning is already exploited in many production management problems (forecasting, storage, production, etc.), the idea is to use it for developing an aided tool in addition to a lean manufacturing classical approach. After presenting the real problem of medicines procurement and dispatching detected in healthcare hospitals, concepts of lean manufacturing and machine learning will be exposed. Then, the methodology proposed for solving the problem will be shown. An illustration will be given for validating concepts presented. Finally, the link with the global “Healthcare logistics 4.0” framework will be described.",Procedia Manufacturing,01/01/2019,10.1016/j.promfg.2020.01.189,0

Efficient estimation of a risk measure requiring two-stage simulation optimization,"This paper is concerned with the efficient estimation of the risk measure of a system where the estimation requires solving a two-stage simulation optimization problem. The first stage samples risk factors that specify a second stage simulation optimization problem. The second stage solves a simulation optimization problem and outputs the best performance of the system under the realized risk factors, which are then aggregated across all first stage samples to produce an estimate of the risk measure. Applications of such an estimation scheme arise frequently in important industries such as financial, healthcare, logistics, and manufacturing. Because a large number of first stage samples are typically needed, each of which requires solving a computationally expensive simulation optimization problem, the two-stage simulation optimization approach faces a major computational efficiency challenge. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes a sequential simulation budget allocation procedure that determines the allocation of simulation budget based on a score known as revised probability of sign change for each decision under each scenario. The consistency of the proposed procedure is proved and the computational efficiency gain of the proposed is demonstrated using both benchmark test functions and two test cases in the context of financial portfolio risk estimation and healthcare system resilience estimation.",European Journal of Operational Research,16/03/2023,10.1016/j.ejor.2022.06.028,1

A case study: Application of network clock model to heterogeneous sensor networks,"A sensor network consists of sensor nodes that have sensing, computation and wireless communication capabilities. There are various sensor network applications, including disaster relief operations, environmental monitoring and control, precision agriculture, intelligent home and buildings, facility management, machine surveillance and preventive maintenance, medicine and healthcare, logistics, telematics, and others. Many of these applications share some basic functionalities, namely event detection, periodic measurement and tracking, all of which entail collecting and forwarding of event data. For the purposes of triggering an action, it is necessary to know when an event occurs. Certainly time is an essential factor in many sensor network applications. This paper proposes, based on a cast study, a network clock model application to heterogeneous sensor networks. The network clock model is a scheme by which a consistent notion of time can be shared among sensor networks’ devices in order to enable the combination of time and data for applications. This work serves to demonstrate the acquisition, keeping and distribution of standard time in a heterogeneous sensor network platform based on the network clock model.",Journal of Communications,01/07/2019,10.12720/jcm.14.7.587-592,1
A case study of collaborative communications within healthcare logistics,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a collaborative communications model developed during the conduct of a recent academic research study and provide information to healthcare supply chain managers and administrators. Design/methodology/approach: Using data collected from a case study involving healthcare supply chain managers in the United States Army, this work examines how collaborative communications is linked to healthcare supply chain management. The findings associated with this study may have many transferable applications to institutions beyond a military health services context. Findings: This paper presents the findings and conclusions ascertained during a case study of collaborative communications. Five emerging themes were identified and a management model was developed for the enhancement of healthcare supply chain operations. Emerging themes included synergy among organizations, stakeholders working together, enhancements in supply chain operations, a continuance of training for supply chain leaders, and commonalities among disparate levels of management. Practical implications: Healthcare is a continually evolving industry. Supply chain efficiency can be linked to potential cost savings and more efficient operations within healthcare organizations. By understanding a model related to communicating collaboratively, leaders begin to understand the need for partnering among internal and external stakeholders and creating more efficient practices and processes. While this discussion is directed specifically toward healthcare management, the principles are applicable across a wide array of industries. Social implications: Communicating effectively is never easy for any healthcare organization or staff. Whether isolated to key individuals or throughout the entire organization, leaders have an inherent responsibility to share information and set conditions for organizational success. Arguably, the critical path to success involves effective, collaborative communications across multiple echelons of management responsibilities. Originality/value: While there is a dearth of literature examining communications and collaboration among various industries, little information is directed specifically toward the management of healthcare organizations or supply chain operations. In an applied sense, this model provides healthcare supply chain managers with concepts related to communicating more effectively at both the individual and organizational levels. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Leadership in Health Services,01/02/2011,10.1108/17511871111102526,1
Oral anticoagulant treatment: A cost-benefit study,"More than 1% of the population are on oral anticoagulant treatment (OAT), a figure which is growing by over 10% annually. The demand for the clinical and analytical services necessary for monitoring this treatment requires the assignment of significant economical and healthcare logistic resources. Comparative studies of the multiple control strategies (attending hospital, primary care or self-monitoring) should be set up, and should reflect not only the costs of their performance but also their clinical results, measures such as mortality and morbidity of thrombotic and haemorrhagic episodes that, have occurred and been avoided. During 2003,20,347 patients on OAT were monitored in 4 anticoagulation units of large national hospitals providing healthcare cover to 1,641,914 inhabitants, Thrombotic or haemorrhagic episodes were recorded and the same events that should have occurred, according to their pathologies, were calculated. Two hundred and ninety-nine thromboembolic complications occurred which led to 129 hospital admissions and there were 11 deaths. Serious haemorrhagic complications resulted in IBI hospital admissions and caused 20 deaths. The costs of OAT in the population attended (medication and their clinical/analytical monitoring) were estimated at €2,749,813,The healthcare costs (calculated according to the DRG of the pathologies) of the clinical complications which occurred were estimated at €1,068,259.

Modelling hospital materials management processes,"Materials management is an important issue for healthcare systems because it influences clinical and financial outcomes. Before selecting, adapting and implementing leading or optimized practices, a good understanding of processes and activities has to be developed. In real applications, the information flows and business strategies involved are different from hospital to hospital, depending on context, culture and available resources; it is therefore difficult to find a comprehensive and exhaustive description of processes, even more so a clear formalization of them. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, it proposes an integrated and detailed analysis and description model for hospital materials management data and tasks, which is able to tackle information from patient requirements to usage, from replenishment requests to supplying and handling activities. The model takes account of medical risk reduction, traceability and streamlined processes perspectives. Second, the paper translates this information into a business process model and mathematical formalization. The study provides a useful guide to the various relevant technology-related, management and business issues, laying the foundations of an efficient reengineering of the supply chain to reduce healthcare costs and improve the quality of care. © 2013 Iannoneet al.",International Journal of Engineering Business Management,01/01/2013,10.5772/56607,1
Logistics chain optimization and scheduling of hospital pharmacy drugs using genetic algorithms: Morocco case,"In recent years, the health sector has faced increasingly important challenges. Due to the economic crisis and competitions, hospitals are facing many issues affecting the supply chain, such as budget cuts or lack thereof as well as insufficient human resources. Although essential for an excellent service, logistics take up a considerable part of the budget as challenges need to be addressed such as delays in drugs delivery, transportation and storage conditions, routing and scheduling. As to governance, each hospital is assigned to a specific region, which cannot be defined due to political, demographic, or geographic issues. This paper focuses on multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP) in healthcare logistics to feed the hospital pharmacies. The idea is to apply MDVRP’s approach to the health sector, specifically hospital pharmacies. In this projection, hospitals are considered to present clients, and central pharmacies present deposits. This problem (the MDVRP) is known by this nature NP-hard. For that, the heuristic method was used as genetic algorithm to solve the problem. The paper is organized as follows, the first section discusses, compares, and proposes clustering methods for healthcare facilities with applying them on Moroccan hospitals case; the second section proposes a genetic algorithm to resolve the MDVRP with a simulation.",International Journal of Web-Based Learning and Teaching Technologies,01/03/2021,10.4018/IJWLTT.2021030104,1
An evaluation of the delivery of medicines using drones,"This study tests the impact of drone transportation on the quality of a medicine. Modelling the critical process parameters of drone flight, the effects of temperature and vibration on insulin were investigated using the pharmacopoeia methods. The medicine, Actrapid, (3.5 mg/mL of insulin), was flown by a quad-rotor drone. Insulin stored between −20 and 40◦C for 30 mins, and subjected to vibration (0–40 Hz, 25◦C, 30 mins) passed the pharmacopeia tests. Dynamic light scattering identified the active tetrameric and hexameric forms of insulin post testing. Vibration frequencies during drone flight were between 0.1 and 3.4 Hz. There was no evidence of visible insulin aggregates following the drone transportation. The differences in UV absorbance readings between flown Actrapid and controls were insignificant (p = 0.89). No adverse impact of drone transport on insulin was observed. This study provides supporting evidence that drone transportation of medicinal products containing insulin is feasible. The authors recommend that when considering the drone delivery of medicines five tests need to be applied. These tests must determine the safe flight time and range, the quality of the medicine post flight, the onboard conditions experienced by the medicine, the security of the drone supply chain and the effect of drone failure on both the medicine and the environment.",Drones,01/09/2019,10.3390/drones3030052,1
Logistical and structural challenges are the major obstacles for family medicine physicians’ ability to administer adult vaccines,"Purpose: This study was conducted to characterize the vaccination practices and challenges of family medicine physicians in Los Angeles County, California. Methods: The Los Angeles Academy of Family Physicians (LA AFP) sent out electronic surveys to all of their active members (N = 1121) between December 2017 and January 2018, and asked them to answer questions about themselves, their practice, their patient population, and their immunization practices and challenges. We then analyzed the results through basic statistical calculations and Pearson’s chi-squared tests. Results: Seventy-four people (6.6%) responded to the survey, and 75% of responders stated that they administer all Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended vaccines. The lowest vaccine administration rates were for the high-dose influenza vaccine, which 66.2% (n = 49) of respondents reported to administer, followed by the meningococcal B vaccine (68.9%; n = 51). The respondents who belonged to practices with more than 11 providers, were part of a large hospital or healthcare system, had electronic medical records (EMRs), and used the California Immunization Registry (CAIR) were more likely to report to vaccinate. The number one responding physician-reported challenge to vaccination was limited time and resources to address patient resistance followed by vaccine cost and lack of infrastructure to store vaccines. Conclusions: In this pilot study, structural and logistical challenges appeared to make the biggest impact on adult vaccination for the responding family medicine physicians. Solutions addressing these challenges will help improve the adult immunization rates.",Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics,04/03/2019,10.1080/21645515.2018.1543524,1
Towards flexible process support on mobile devices,"Ubiquitous computing is considered as enabler for linking everyday life with information and communication technology. However, developing pervasive and mobile applications that provide personalized user assistance still constitutes a challenge. Mobile application scenarios are diverse and encompass domains like healthcare, logistics, and sales. For their support two fundamental technologies with increasing maturity are emerging: development frameworks for mobile devices and light-weight process engines. Their integrated use, however, is in a rather premature state. Generally, the use of a process engine for supporting mobile collaboration raises many challenging issues. This paper picks up some of these challenges and shows how we have coped with them in the MARPLE project. MARPLE targets at a tight integration of process management technology with mobile computing frameworks in order to enable mobile process support in advanced application scenarios. We give insights into the MARPLE architecture and its components. In particular, we introduce the MARPLE process engine, which enables light-weight as well as flexible process support on mobile devices. This will be key for mobile user assistance in advanced application scenarios. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,01/01/2011,10.1007/978-3-642-17722-4_11,1
Pharmacy students' perspectives on the value of taking call during acute care practice experiences,"Objective. Determine graduates' perceptions of the benefits and limitations of taking call with the medicine team while in the experiential portion of the doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) degree program. Methods. Survey questionnaires were mailed to graduates who completed a medicine advanced pharmacy practice experience offering an on-call experience. Data collected included on-call requirements, participation, and perceptions of the benefits and limitations of participating in on-call activities. Results. Respondents generally agreed that they learned more about disease states and healthcare logistics during on-call experiences. Respondents also agreed it was a teambuilding experience and would encourage other students to take call. Conclusions. Taking call as a pharmacy student provides a unique opportunity to learn about disease states and build professional relationships with other healthcare professionals. This initial survey suggests that the perceived benefits of taking call outweigh the limitations, and that the experience incorporates professional development into pharmacy education.",American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education,01/01/2005,10.5688/aj690348,0
Healthcare logistics &amp; supply chain management in health industry of Indonesia based on the telemedicine,"The essential mission of logistics and supply chain management is to efficiently plan, organize, and coordinate the movement of goods from a point of origin to a point of consumption. Analyzing and aligning supply chain goals with a patient-first approach enables healthcare organizations to reduce costs while improving patient outcomes. With Patient Direct, a care delivery solution from HRS, this paper provides patients with the telehealth equipment they need when they need it by telemedicine. Telemedicine which is used interchangeably with the term telehealth is the remote delivery of healthcare to patients through information and communication technology, including communication between two or more health professionals who are not in the same location. Thus, it needs secure transmission of medical data through text, sound, image, or video. This system can be a tele-education, tele-monitoring, tele-consultation, or tele-intervention. Telemedicine has several benefits, both for health professionals and medical institution as well as for the patients, especially for the development of healthcare delivery in remote area and also to make interaction between healthcare professional faster. However, telemedicine still has lack of regulation in Indonesia. There is still no regulation about license for the health professional and safety of medical data. Ethical problems in telemedicine are also still an issue, especially about patient's confidentiality, and also it can weaken doctor-patients relationship. According code of ethics, a doctor must examine the patients first before making a diagnosis and treatment, which cannot be done with telemedicine. The lack of regulation and ethical consideration make telemedicine in Indonesia still has some problems and need a challenge for improvement.",International Journal of Supply Chain Management,01/01/2020,,0

These devices are expected to generate significant amounts of data requests at high data rates, therefore, necessitating the performance benchmarking of IoT platforms to ascertain whether they can efficiently handle such devices. In this article, we present our results gathered from extensive performance evaluation of the cloud-based IoT platform, FIWARE. In particular, to study FIWARE's performance, we developed a testbed and generated CoAP and MQTT data to emulate large-scale IoT deployments, crucial for future smart cities. We performed extensive tests and studied FIWARE's performance regarding vertical and horizontal scalability. We present bottlenecks and limitations regarding FIWARE components and their cloud deployment. Finally, we discuss cost-efficient FIWARE deployment strategies that can be extremely beneficial to stakeholders aiming to deploy FIWARE as an IoT platform for smart cities.",Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,01/10/2019,10.1016/j.jpdc.2018.12.010,1
Simulation optimization for the inventory management of healthcare supplies,"This article covers the inventory management of healthcare supplies problem. Based on the mathematical programming model set out by [1], a causal model and a flow chart were developed to outline the simulation model, which was to be later applied to a highly specialized medical institution that performs high-risk heart surgery, such as catheterizations and angioplasties. With this simulation model, a purchases plan with 21 healthcare supplies was obtained that contemplates all the problem’s restrictions: purchasing policy (safety stock, available budget); the warehouse’s physical reality (warehouse capacity); characteristics of supplies (useful life, service level); and suppliers (price, capacity and size of lots or rounding value). Different indicators were also considered, such as service levels, costs of purchases, stockouts costs and inventory maintenance costs. The results obtained with the simulation model came very close to the mathematical programming results, but the computing times were considerably shorter.",International Journal of Simulation Modelling,01/06/2020,10.2507/IJSIMM19-2-514,0
Impacts of Losses Functions on the Quality of the Ultrasound Image by Using Machine Learning Algorithms,"During last decade, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been able to reshape our life daily. Different areas were positively impacted by AI such as Healthcare, Logistic, etc. Medical imaging is one of the fields of healthcare in which AI was introduced to solve and overcome different problems. Challenges including image processing, signal processing, and data acquisition. In this paper, we deeply demonstrate the loss function as one of the main parameters that influence the quality of the ultrasound (US) image. Therefore, we introduce the main components of ultrasound systems form end-to-end perspective such as the data acquisition, the signal processing, and the image interpretation. Then, we present the losses functions as a critical performance metrics for the model validation. Metrics such as the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Cross-Entropy loss function (CE), Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), and the Structural Similarity (SSIM). After that we present the adopted CNN model to generate ultrasound image. The excessive simulation results demonstrate that the selection of the loss function provides significant improvement in terms of image quality (e.g., contrast, CNR and SNR). Choosing simple loss functions such as mean square error helps to faster the convergence of the convolution neural network during the training process. However, for image quality enhancement, we propose the combination of different loss functions such structural similarity (SSIM) with Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).","2021 IEEE International Conference on Automatic Control and Intelligent Systems, I2CACIS 2021 - Proceedings",26/06/2021,10.1109/I2CACIS52118.2021.9495878,0
Transportation-Induced Carbon Emissions Jeopardize Healthcare Logistics Sustainability: Toward a Healthier Today and a Better Tomorrow,"Background: Logistics operations are considered essential for transporting commodities from one location to another, helping to promote global economic activity. On the other hand, its negative impact eclipses its positive impact, namely the rise in healthcare expenditures due to its ecological footprint. Globally, rising out-of-pocket health expenses result from logistic-induced carbon emissions, posing a danger to the long-term viability of healthcare. Methods: Based on this critical fact, this study examined the impact of logistics operations on healthcare costs by controlling for carbon emissions, fuel imports, and economic development across a large cross-section of 131 nations by using the Robust Least Squares Regression. Results: The findings demonstrate a U-shaped association between logistical operations and healthcare expenditures, i.e., if there is a 1% increase in logistics operations, healthcare expenditures decrease by −2.421% initially, while at later stages, healthcare costs would increase by 0.139%. On the other hand, increased fuel imports and economic growth due to logistics activities are increasing healthcare expenditures with an elasticity estimate of 0.087% and 0.147%, respectively. According to the forecasting predictions, logistics-induced carbon emissions, fuel imports, and economic expansion will increase healthcare expenses. Conclusions: A sustainable logistics operation is critical for strengthening healthcare infrastructure and meeting the global carbon neutrality goal.",Logistics,01/06/2022,10.3390/logistics6020027,0

Benchmarking of health technologies distribution models: An investigation of Lombardy’s local health authorities,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to develop a benchmarking framework for assessing the performance of the distribution models adopted by the local branches of National Health Services (NHSs) for delivering health technologies to patients at a local level, and to derive prescriptions for enhancing design and optimal management of the distribution models. Design/methodology/approach – The authors focussed the study on the distribution of absorbent devices for incontinence, adopting the analytic hierarchy process as a tool for developing the benchmarking framework. The authors applied the framework to the context of the Italian NHS with respect to the Lombard Local Health Authorities, assessing their performance in terms of operational efficiency and service quality. Findings – The developed framework constitutes a novel contribution, and it allows for generating prescriptions. Through its application to the context studied the authors found that a “one-size-fits-all” distribution model cannot be proposed, as regards both efficiency and effectiveness, since process standardization does not provide benefits or savings in all contexts. Rather, a total landed cost approach in the evaluation of the distribution practices must be adopted. Practical implications – This paper offers to managers and decision makers an innovative approach to the design of distribution models for health technologies. It provides policy makers with prescriptions to develop regulations fostering a comprehensive view of the factors for an optimal health technologies distribution at a local level. Originality/value – Given the dearth of scientific publications focussed on the distribution at the local level of health technologies, this paper significantly contributes to the existing body of knowledge and it offers an innovative framework which can be proficiently replicated in manifold contexts.",Benchmarking,03/05/2016,10.1108/BIJ-12-2013-0123,0

Modelling the growing process of integrated healthcare supply networks,"This work contributes to the practice of healthcare system modelling, by presenting an urgent issue: the growing process of integrated healthcare supply networks in reducing public healthcare systems' annual expenses and improving performance. Various critical aspects affect the strategic design and development of healthcare logistic networks in practice. The conceptual discussion is empirically derived on the basis of the challenge created by the development of centralized healthcare supply networks supported by the implementation of new IT/IS investments and advanced logistic hubs for hospital material inventory management. The study moves towards the development of a newer ""Healthcare Supply Network Causal Loop Diagram,"" to analyse and predict the growth pattern of a healthcare logistic network in its complexity, and understand how well the supply network will fit with the benefit provided by new logistic economies of scale and the risk of failures under uncertainty.","Healthcare Administration: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications",31/08/2014,10.4018/978-1-4666-6339-8.ch019,0
Real-time management of intra-hospital patient transport requests,"This paper addresses the management of patients’ transportation requests within a hospital, a very challenging problem where requests must be scheduled among the available porters so that patients arrive at their destination timely and the resources invested in patient transport are kept as low as possible. Transportation requests arrive during the day in an unpredictable manner, so they need to be scheduled in real-time. To ensure that the requests are scheduled in the best possible manner, one should also reconsider the decisions made on pending requests that have not yet been completed, a process that will be referred to as rescheduling. This paper proposes several policies to trigger and execute the rescheduling of pending requests and three approaches (a mathematical formulation, a constructive heuristic, and a local search heuristic) to solve each rescheduling problem. A simulation tool is proposed to assess the performance of the rescheduling strategies and the proposed scheduling methods to tackle instances inspired by a real mid-size hospital. Compared to a heuristic that mimics the way requests are currently handled in our partner hospital, the best combination of scheduling method and rescheduling strategy produces an average 5.7 minutes reduction in response time and a 13% reduction in the percentage of late requests. Furthermore, since the total distance walked by porters is substantially reduced, our experiments demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the number of porters – and therefore the operating costs – without reducing the current level of service.",Health Care Management Science,01/01/2024,10.1007/s10729-024-09667-6,0
Potential impact of RFID-based tracing systems on the integrity of pharmaceutical products,"Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is going to play a crucial role as auto-identification technology in a wide range of applications such as healthcare, logistics, supply chain management, ticketing, et cetera. The use of electromagnetic waves to identify, trace, and track people or goods allows solving many problems related to auto-identification devices based on optical reading (i.e. bar code). Currently, high interest is concentrated on the use of Radio Frequency (RF) solutions in healthcare and pharmaceutical supply chain, in order to improve drugs flow transparency and patients' safety. Unfortunately, there is a possibility that drug interaction with electromagnetic fields (EMFs) generated by RF devices, such as RFID readers, deteriorate the potency of bioactive compounds. This chapter proposes an experimental multidisciplinary approach to investigate potential alterations induced by EMFs on drug molecular structure and performance. To show the versatility of this approach, some experimental results obtained on two biological pharmaceuticals (peptide hormone-based) are discussed. © 2013, IGI Global.","Advanced RFID Systems, Security, and Applications",01/12/2012,10.4018/978-1-4666-2080-3.ch011,0

Iterative matheuristic for the biomedical sample transportation problem,"This paper proposes an iterative matheuristic for solving the biomedical sample transportation problem (BSTP), which is a routing problem with multiple and interdependent visits in the context of healthcare services. In this problem, the biomedical samples are collected from individuals at a set of healthcare or specimen collection centers and must be transported to designated laboratories to be analyzed. The perishable nature of the specimens forces to visit the collection centers more than once a day to ensure that the time from the moment they are drawn to the arrival at the laboratory do not exceed the samples lifespan. Also, a visit to one center imposes (1) a limit on the duration of the route that transports its samples to the laboratory, and (2) a limit on the latest time at which the same center must be visited again, creating an interdependency between visits, routes and the decision concerning the centers’ opening times. This paper first proposes a mathematical formulation to model the BSTP. Since this formulation is not able to solve medium or large sized instances efficiently, it also proposes an iterative matheuristic, which includes two main steps. The first step produces an approximated solution to the BSTP by a decomposition approach that splits the problem into a series of smaller subproblems that are solved by the proposed mathematical formulation. In the second step, two fix-&-optimize strategies are used with the mathematical formulation to perform a local search around the solutions produced by the decomposition method. The matheuristic has demonstrated its efficiency solving a rich set of real-life instances corresponding to the needs of several regions in the province of Quebec, Canada, in a fraction of the time required to solve the exact mathematical formulation.",Computers and Industrial Engineering,01/06/2024,10.1016/j.cie.2024.110196,0
How to use lean manufacturing for improving a Healthcare logistics performance,"Most companies in the world are focused on their global performance for being competitive on the market. Lean manufacturing is one of the main methodologies used by them for increasing their supply chain and logistics performance. Indeed, Logistics performance improvement implies the definition of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for measuring at each transformation level, the evolution of the logistics system. Thus, Industry 4.0 and logistics 4.0 concepts are defined for implementing new technologies, tools and organizations in companies in order to define their future. A new framework, based on lean manufacturing and DMAIC methodologies, with sustainability as its kernel has been developed in Icam, A Higher education school, for SMEs. In addition, European population is growing older day by day and they are regularly visiting hospitals. In this context, the treatment of patients in good conditions (quality, cost and lead time) is necessary as much as the hospital global performance. In this frame, a project is ongoing between FEI, a Brazilian University and Icam for defining and implementing Healthcare Logistics 4.0 (including lean manufacturing). This paper presents concepts, methods and tools of healthcare logistics 4.0 for improving a hospital performance.

A Decision Support Tool for the Location Routing Problem During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Colombia,"During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Bogotá, Colombia, some strategies for dealing with the increasing number of infected people and the level of occupation of intensive care units include the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). PPE is a crucial component for patient care and a priority for protecting healthcare workers. For attending this necessity, the location of distribution centers within the city and the corresponding routes to supply the intensive care units (ICU) with PPE have an important role. Formally, this problem is defined as the Location Routing Problem (LRP). The LRP is an NP-Hard problem that combines the Facility Location Problem (FLP) and the Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Depots (MDVRP). This work presents a decision support tool based on a simheuristic method that hybridize an Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm with Monte Carlo simulation to deal with the LRP with uncertain demands. Realistic data from Bogotá (Colombia) was retrieved using Google Maps to characterize the geographical distribution of both potential facilities and ICUs, while demands were generated using the uniform probability distribution.

Hybridizing a matheuristic with ALNS for the optimal collection and delivery of medical specimens,"The past few years of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak have shown that optimal management of medical specimens is a key aspect of healthcare logistics, both for addressing the delivery of perishable items such as vaccines, and for ensuring the timely analysis of swabs and samples. Accordingly, recent optimization literature described the problem of optimal collection and delivery of medical specimens, modeled as a multitrip vehicle routing problem with time windows and a completion time objective function. Aiming to achieve good-quality solutions in short computational times, this work describes a hybrid approach, combining a matheuristic construction phase with an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS). Our matheuristic relies on a clustering algorithm to yield subsets of the medical specimens that are optimally served by single vehicles of the fleet. The solutions of the matheuristic phase serve as starting points for the ALNS intensification phase. Extensive experimentation on both new and established benchmark problem instances shows that our hybrid method is able to match the optimality of the state of the art on small instances and outperforms the existing exact method by one order of magnitude on larger problems.",International Transactions in Operational Research,01/01/2023,10.1111/itor.13386,0

A novel group ownership transfer protocol for RFID systems,"Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a wireless communication technology nowadays widely used in almost every aspect of our lives including healthcare, logistics and supply chain management, inventory tracking, race timing, access control, toll collection, and a lot more. In RFID systems, a tag usually stores private or sensitive information, and so it needs an access control mechanism. When a tag's owner is changed, the read permission of the tag needs to be transferred from the old owner to the new owner, and this is when ownership transfer schemes come into play. In fact, not only do RFID ownership transfer schemes do ownership transfer, but they have to make sure that the ownership transfer procedure is executed under proper security protection. Besides, in some particular environments, the ownership transfer would be far more efficiently done if the tags could be treated as a group instead of individual tags. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel group ownership transfer protocol that satisfies all important security requirements including mutual authentication, data and location privacy, forward/backward secrecy, ownership privacy, and group ownership integrity. In addition, due to the use of cloud computing, our new protocol provides ubiquitous authentication. Based on homomorphic encryption and quadratic residues, our novel RFID group ownership transfer protocol can have encrypted data efficiently processed, and the communication cost is very low. The results of our BAN logic correctness check, security analysis, and performance evaluation confirm that the new protocol is logically correct and is capable of providing high level security/privacy protection on the basis of high cost-effective performance.",Ad Hoc Networks,01/08/2019,10.1016/j.adhoc.2019.101873,0
