Enhancing healthcare supply chain management through artificial intelligence-driven group decision-making with Sugeno–Weber triangular norms in a dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy context,"The healthcare industry faces numerous challenges in managing its supply chain efficiently, where critical decisions must be made promptly to ensure the availability of essential medical resources. This research introduces a novel artificial intelligence (AI) approach, utilizing the “Sugeno–Weber (SW) t-conorms and t-norms” (SWt-CNs&t-Ns) for decision-making in a Dual Hesitant q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy (DHq-ROF) context. The SWt-CNs&t-Ns are chosen for their adaptability in data unification, serving as prominent operations for union and intersection processes. Developing a set of fundamental operations is imperative to effectively utilize SWt-CNs&t-Ns and hybrid aggregation operators in DHq-ROF settings. Following the introduction of these processes, several aggregating operators have been provided. These operators include DHq-ROF SW weighted averaging, ordered weighted averaging, hybrid averaging, and their geometric counterparts utilizing DHq-ROF data. The SW triangular norm-based approach aggregates group preferences, facilitating a systematic decision-making process. Triangular norms ensure a realistic representation of interrelationships among decision criteria, leading to optimal healthcare supply chain management solutions. Furthermore, the SW triangular norm-based approach aggregates group preferences, enabling a systematic and comprehensive decision-making process. Choosing the best healthcare supply chain management solutions is easier when you use triangular norms because they give a more accurate picture of how the decision criteria affect each other. The effectiveness of the proposed AI framework is demonstrated through a series of experiments and case studies, showcasing its ability to enhance decision accuracy, reduce uncertainty, and improve overall supply chain performance. The research findings underscore the potential of AI-driven solutions to revolutionize healthcare supply chain management, ultimately leading to better resource allocation, cost efficiency, and improved patient care.",Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2024-09-01,10.1016/j.engappai.2024.108794
Technological implementation in the service sector: A case study,"The service industry is a crucial industry recognized as the biggest of the three sectors of the economy. Implementing technology in this industry has been the driving force for industrial advancement. In contrast, this industry's disproportionate adoption of technology explains the disparity between developing and developed worlds. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been recognized as the newest technology disrupting and driving innovation in the service industry, with the quest for superior business experience and customer service driving its adoption. However, AI is not the only technology driving transformations in the service industry but also a constituent of innovative technologies, such as search, chatbots, cloud computing, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), mobile, social, and the IoT. In addition, this chapter advocates for the fourth component of cloud computing to be named diversity as a service (DaaS). Technology is the most significant enabler of globalization. Globalization is the most fantastic driver of diversities-creating opportunities, virtual, and physical, for people from different cultural, religious, racial, geographical, and other backgrounds to interact. However, this confluence of diversities is leading to unsavory human experiences giving rise to racial protests, gender inequalities, underrepresentation of ethnic minorities, and others. However, implementing technology in diversity management could be the elixir to these problems. The chapter seeks to explore the implications of technology implementation in the service industry to ascertain whether the economic impact of technology in the service industry influences its adoption and how to encourage technology adoption in the service industry. The chapter also analyzes whether technology implementation in the service sector is economical to provide organizations with a decision-making tool for further exploring the industry and making experimental projections of technology's prognosis in the service industry to encourage research and scientific activity. This is because many or most of the literature on AI are projections, simulations, and assumptions emphasizing how the implementation of AI will increase unemployment and change the labor landscape in ways that may not be familiar to many. We adapted the core generalizations from some of these reports to evaluate these projections. Academic and research reports from the sciences, engineering, and medicine on information technology (IT) and the U.S. workforce into an analytical framework because it embodies the core assumptions of most of the literature on the subject. We then used the analytical framework to analyze secondary data from those who have implemented these technologies to see whether the implementation of technology in the service sector was economical or not and whether economic factors affected the adoption of the technology. Finally, we explored possible extensions of existing knowledge as experimental projections to encourage further research. Furthermore, the chapter explored three critical sectors of the service industry as case studies, including the Healthcare, Logistics, and Entertainment sectors, and attempted an economic analysis of the implementation of technology in these sectors and projected experimental investigation of the consequences of implementing technology in these sectors in the future. It was noticed that the implementation of technology in the service industry is gaining increased adoption with signs of growing adoption into the future. Economically, the performance of technology increases productivity, lowers costs, and transforms the way work is done and changes the labor landscape, with machines gaining greater involvement and acceptance as co-workers with human counterparts. This shows the economic benefits of implementing technology in the service sector in increasing its adoption. Most importantly, it was established that different levels of education, not technology, are the causes of income inequalities. Generally, the implementation of technology increases the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery in these sectors, leading to labor efficiency, increased productivity, and cost-effectiveness. Experimentally, the chapter projects that we are entering the era of flying cargoes and rocket-like cargo ships. The chapter concludes with claims that though machines will see greater adoption in the entertainment industry, they will not substitute human creativity in serving entertainment, and humans will always cherish entertainment served by humans and treat machine-generated entertainment as fiction.",Artificial Intelligence for Smart Technology in the Hospitality and Tourism Industry,2024-07-05,
Investigating the Impact of Drone Transport on the Stability of Monoclonal Antibodies for Inter-Hospital Transportation,"In the field of healthcare logistics, the reliance on conventional transport methods such as cars for the delivery of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is susceptible to challenges posed by traffic and infrastructure, leading to increased and unpredictable transport times. Recognizing the potential role of drones in mitigating these challenges, we aimed to investigate the impact of medical drone transport on the stability of mAbs. Compromised stability could lead to aggregation and immunogenicity, thereby jeopardizing the efficacy and safety of mAbs. We studied the transportation of vials as well as ready-to-administer infusion bags with blinatumomab, tocilizumab, and daratumumab. The methodology involved the measurement of both temperature and mechanical shock during drone transport. Moreover, the analytical techniques High Performance Size-Exclusion Chromatography (HP-SEC), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Light Obscuration (LO), Micro-Flow Imaging (MFI), and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) were employed to comprehensively assess the presence of aggregates and particle formation. The key findings revealed no significant differences between car and drone transport, indicating that the stability of mAbs in both vials and infusion bags was adequately maintained during drone transport. This suggests that medical drones are a viable and reliable means for the inter-hospital transport of mAbs, paving the way for more efficient and predictable logistics in healthcare delivery.",Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences,2024-07-01,10.1016/j.xphs.2024.04.002
The Metaheuristic Optimization Techniques in Text Classification,"Metaheuristic algorithms, inspired by natural phenomena and human-based strategies, offer versatile approaches to navigate diverse search spaces and adapt to dynamic environments. These algorithms, including evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, bio-inspired methods, human-based approaches, and plant-inspired techniques, have found applications across diverse domains such as engineering, finance, healthcare, logistics, and telecommunications. In the text classification domain, metaheuristic techniques have emerged as powerful tools to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of classification systems. By optimizing feature subsets, fine-tuning model parameters, and addressing challenges such as feature selection, dimensionality reduction, class imbalance, and noisy data, metaheuristic algorithms provide flexible solutions that adapt to various text datasets and tasks. This review paper comprehensively explores recent advancements in metaheuristic applications in text classification across six categories.

Handling uncertainty in the specification of autonomous multi-robot systems through mission adaptation,"Multi-robot systems (MRS) have gained interest as a versatile paradigm for complex task execution across various domains such as healthcare, logistics, and maintenance. Often, they are called to operate in variable and dynamic environments, which makes uncertainties arise and affect those systems. Uncertainties require the system to be able to adapt its behavior at runtime, in response to the changing and unpredictable conditions in its operating environment. Moreover, often the behavior of the robots cannot be completely anticipated at design time. Consequently, static mission planning is not always suitable: mission specifications need to take into account the uncertainties and, hence, be dynamic and re-configurable at runtime, when the required knowledge is available.This work focuses on the realization of adaptable multi-robot systems, which are capable of dealing with uncertainties by adapting their mission at runtime. We introduce the concept of ""adaptable task"" that is used in the global mission specification of the MRS to identify the mission tasks affected by uncertainties. Adaptation alternatives are modeled as sub-missions and associated with the adaptable task. At runtime, ad hoc written ""trigger functions"" executed by robots sense and evaluate the environment and select the most suitable adaptation alternative to be executed.We have experimented with the approach by simulating a use case to assess its validity. The system was able to adapt its behavior in response to the environmental conditions, thus allowing the fulfillment of the mission goals. We also discuss the applicability of the use case on a set of known single- and multi-robot systems.","Proceedings - 2024 IEEE/ACM 19th Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems, SEAMS 2024",2024-04-15,10.1145/3643915.3644099
Home healthcare in Spanish rural areas: Applying vehicle routing algorithms to health transport management,"Depopulation of rural areas poses a range of new challenges for the provision of public services. Access to primary care centres is essential for promoting and protecting quality of life, especially for the older population. However, many rural municipalities face abandonment from public administrations by not even having a local clinic and forcing their dwellers to drive to the nearest facility. This research examines the adequacy of providing home healthcare (HHC) systems in such areas to avoid unnecessary trips. When designing routes to provide these services, decision-makers must take into account the following: (i) wide geographical spread of places to visit; (ii) difficulty in accessing some of these places with heavy medically equipped vehicles; and (iii) uncertainty regarding places to visit and availability of professionals. Our study identifies municipalities in which the travelling distance to the closest centre is above a desirable threshold, estimating the magnitude of the problem. Then, we provide an illustrative example in which an agile methodology is presented to design efficient routes that allow policymakers to offer HHC services of reasonable quality.",Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,2024-04-01,10.1016/j.seps.2024.101828

Furthermore, we explore the potential of machine learning in addressing operational challenges within healthcare. By examining various machine learning algorithms, we identify their advantages and limitations, proposing a structured method of application. Through this analysis, we aim to illuminate how machine learning can minimize patient waiting times and optimize overall healthcare operations. This inspection aims to elucidate how machine learning methodologies can mitigate patient wait times and refine overall healthcare logistics. By amalgamating cutting-edge technologies with strategic methodologies, healthcare entities can leverage the transformative capabilities of machine learning to enhance operational efficiency and elevate the delivery of patient care.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2024-01-01,10.1007/978-3-031-63211-2_15
Fractal-Based N-Environment Multi-Agent IoT System Reliability,"The tremendous growth of Internet of Things (IoT) systems and the popularity of distributed systems, which were brought back into fashion by containerisation, create new challenges for system maintenance. Each IoT-specific service is characterised by a specific domain, or environment, making the maintenance of distributed IoT systems with dozens of agents a challenging task. This paper proposes a fractal-based mathematical model, called the fractal multi-agent IoT system (FMAIS), for scalable multi-agent systems (e.g. cloud-native services, wide-scale IoT services). A reliability estimation model called the multi-environment enhanced real-time customer-oriented reliability estimation (ME-ERT-CORE) model is proposed as a method for estimating the reliability of a multi-agent IoT system, where each agent can be specified by its own domain-specific environment (e.g. healthcare, logistics, smart factories, etc.). An estimation of the time complexity of the FMAIS is performed, and a model called ME-ERT-CORE for estimating its reliability is formulated. The results show that the FMAIS can be used for real-time simulations of system behaviour and ME-ERT-CORE can be used for the real-time estimation of its reliability, monitoring purposes, and, for instance, quality of service (QoS) descriptions based on service level agreement (SLA) requirements. The conducted measurements show that the reliability of the FMAIS with 4 layers and 96 applications, where each application deploys 96 instances, can be computed in 8.022 milliseconds. With the proposed optimisation method, the reliability for the same FMAIS can be computed in 0.219 milliseconds, which is 36 times faster than the ME-ERT-CORE reliability evaluation based on the definition. An FMAIS with the aforementioned parameters can be simulated in 84.300 milliseconds.",IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2024-01-01,10.1109/JIOT.2024.3398406
Medrone,"In order to address the pressing healthcare challenges faced by isolated communities in remote regions, this project proposes the development of an innovative Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a focus on autonomous navigation, advanced object detection, and collision avoidance systems for efficient and reliable delivery of life-saving medicines and equipment. The UAV will be equipped with autonomous navigation capabilities, allowing it to operate without direct human intervention. This is particularly crucial in regions lacking proper infrastructure, where manual control may be impractical. The autonomous system will utilize GPS technology to ensure precise navigation and route planning, optimizing the efficiency of medical deliveries. To enhance the UAV's capability to operate in unpredictable environments, object detection systems will be integrated. This technology will enable the UAV to identify and navigate around obstacles such as trees, buildings, or uneven terrain. Utilizing a combination of cameras and ultrasonic sensors, the UAV will continuously scan its surroundings, making real-time decisions to avoid collisions and ensure a safe and reliable delivery path. The UAV's collision avoidance system will go beyond simple obstacle detection by actively predicting potential collision scenarios and taking preventive measures. This real-time decision-making process will be essential for navigating through challenging geographical landscapes like mountains and forests. In addition to its navigation and obstacle avoidance capabilities, the UAV will be equipped with a package deployment mechanism. This system will allow for the precise and controlled release of medical supplies at designated delivery points, ensuring that essential resources reach their intended destinations accurately and safely.

Navigating uncertain distribution problem: a new approach for resolution optimization of transportation with several objectives under uncertainty,"Amidst uncertainty, decision-making in manufacturing becomes a central focus due to its complexity. This study explores complex transportation constraints and uses novel ways to guide manufacturers. The Multi-objective Stochastic Linear Fractional Transportation Problem (MOSLFTP) is a crucial tool for managing supply chains, manufacturing operations, energy distribution, emergency routes, healthcare logistics, and other related areas. It adeptly addresses uncertainty, transforming efficiency and effectiveness in several domains. Stochastic programming is the process of converting theoretical probabilities into concrete certainties. The artistic compromise programming technique acts as a proficient mediator, reconciling opposing objectives and enabling equitable decision-making. This novel approach also addresses the Multi-objective Stochastic Linear plus Linear Fractional Transportation Problem (MOSLPLFTP), which involves two interconnected issues. The effectiveness of these principles is clearly shown with the help of the LINGO® 18 optimization solver. This study uses a ranking method to compare the similar methods to solve the current problems. A meticulously designed example acts as a significant achievement, shedding light on our method in a practical setting. It serves as a distinctive instrument, leading manufacturers through the maze of uncertainty and assisting them in determining the most advantageous course of action. This journey involves subtle interactions between complexity and simplicity, uncertainty is overcome by decisiveness, and invention is predominant.",Frontiers in Mechanical Engineering,2024-01-01,10.3389/fmech.2024.1389791

Enhancing COVID-19 vaccination and medication distribution routing strategies in rural regions of Morocco: A comparative metaheuristics analysis,"The optimization of the vaccination campaign and medication distribution in rural regions of Morocco conducted by the Ministry of Health can be significantly improved by employing metaheuristic algorithms in conjunction with a tour planning system. This research proposes the utilization of six metaheuristic algorithms: genetic algorithm, rat swarm optimization, whale optimization, spotted hyena optimizer, penguins search optimization, and particle swarm optimization, to determine the most efficient routes for equipped trucks carrying vaccines and medications. These algorithms consider critical field constraints, such as operating hours of vaccination centers, vaccine availability, and distances between centers while minimizing the overall journey duration.

An Automated Enhancement System of Diabetic Retinopathy Fundus Image for Eye Care Facilities,"Examining retinal fundus images is compulsory for ophthalmologists to spot features of eye diseases. Some problems, including low contrast and blurred retinal fundus image, may seriously affect the diagnostic procedure, leading to misdiagnosis. Low quality of retinal fundus image makes recognition of features for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) to be harder for the ophthalmologist. Moreover, there is a lack of eye care facilities infrastructure with ophthalmologists to serve multi-morbid DR patients in rural areas, specifically Malaysia. Hence, this research proposed the development of an automated enhancement system based on computer vision and the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field to improve the quality of fundus images captured. The DR Enhancement System (DRES) helps ophthalmologists in the screening aspect by improving the detection of aberrant fundus images. Several methods for improving the fundus image are utilized: Retinex, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and Low-light enhancement.

An efficient adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm based on heuristics and reformulations for the generalized quadratic assignment problem,"Operations Research (OR) analytics play a crucial role in optimizing decision-making processes for real-world problems. The assignment problem, with applications in supply chains, healthcare logistics, and production scheduling, represents a prominent optimization challenge. This paper focuses on addressing the Generalized Quadratic Assignment Problem (GQAP), a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. To tackle the GQAP, we propose an OR analytical approach that incorporates efficient relaxations, reformulations, heuristics, and a metaheuristic algorithm. Initially, we employ the Reformulation Linearization Technique (RLT) to generate various linear relaxation models, carefully selecting the most efficient ones. Building upon this foundation, we introduce a robust reformulation based on Benders Decomposition (BD), which serves as the basis for an iterative optimization algorithm applied to the GQAP. Furthermore, we develop a constructive heuristic algorithm to identify near-optimal solutions, followed by an enhancement utilizing an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) metaheuristic algorithm. This ALNS algorithm is enhanced through the integration of a tabu list derived from Tabu Search (TS) and a decision rule inspired by Simulated Annealing (SA).

The COVID-19 pandemic and follow-up for shoulder surgery: The impact of a shift toward telemedicine on validated patient-reported outcomes,"Introduction: The emergence of COVID-19 and its ensuing restrictions on in-person healthcare has resulted in a sudden shift towards the utilization of telemedicine. The purpose of this study is to assess patient satisfaction and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for individuals who underwent follow-up for shoulder surgery using telemedicine compared to those who received traditional in-person clinic follow-up. Methods: Patients who underwent either rotator cuff repair or total shoulder arthroplasty during a designated pre-COVID-19 (traditional clinic follow-up) or peri-COVID-19 (telemedicine follow-up) span of time were identified. PROMs including the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons standardized assessment form, the three-level version of the EQ-5D form, the 12-Item Short Form survey, and a modified version of a published telemedicine survey were administered to participants six months post-operatively via phone call. Results: Sixty patients agreed to participate. There was no significant difference between the pre-COVID-19 and peri-COVID-19 groups in patient satisfaction with their follow-up visit (p = 0.289), nor was there a significant difference in PROMs between the two groups. In total, 83.33% of the telemedicine group and 70.37% of the in-person clinic group preferred traditional in-person follow-up over telemedicine. Discussion: In a cohort of patients who underwent telemedicine follow-up for shoulder surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no difference in patient satisfaction and PROMs compared to traditional in-person clinic follow-up. This study indicates that while the majority of participants preferred face-to-face visits, patients were relatively satisfied with their care and had similar functional outcome scores in both groups, despite the large disruption in healthcare logistics caused by COVID-19.",Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare,2023-07-01,10.1177/1357633X21990997
Divide and Conquer: A Location-Allocation Approach to Sectorization,"Sectorization is concerned with dividing a large territory into smaller areas, also known as sectors. This process usually simplifies a complex problem, leading to easier solution approaches to solving the resulting subproblems. Sectors are built with several criteria in mind, such as equilibrium, compactness, contiguity, and desirability, which vary with the applications. Sectorization appears in different contexts: sales territory design, political districting, healthcare logistics, and vehicle routing problems (agrifood distribution, winter road maintenance, parcel delivery). Environmental problems can also be tackled with a sectorization approach; for example, in municipal waste collection, water distribution networks, and even in finding more sustainable transportation routes. This work focuses on sectorization concerning the location of the area’s centers and allocating basic units to each sector. Integer programming models address the location-allocation problems, and various formulations implementing different criteria are compared. Methods to deal with multiobjective optimization problems, such as the (Formula presented.) -constraint, the lexicographic, and the weighted sum methods, are applied and compared. Computational results obtained for a set of benchmarking instances of sectorization problems are also presented.",Mathematics,2023-06-01,10.3390/math11112553
The influence of supply chain immunity perceptions on COVID-19 vaccine willingness in supply chain professionals,"Purpose: This study examines the lack of confidence in the actions of the government and pharmaceutical companies during vaccine deployment. The authors introduce the concept of supply chain immunity. The authors test whether the perception of higher vaccine supply chain immunity leads to higher willingness to be vaccinated within the supply chain community. Design/methodology/approach: The authors utilize factor analysis and item response theory methods to develop a scale for measuring supply chain immunity. The original and psychometrically sound scale is tested via a structural equation model (SEM). Factor analysis and SEM use survey responses from two samples of 125 supply chain executives. Findings: SEM suggests that supply chain immunity perceptions are a strong predictor of overall supply chain confidence for COVID vaccines. Further, these perceptions, through supply chain confidence, indirectly impact individuals' self-reported willingness to personally accept a vaccine themselves. Originality/value: This paper presents the concept of supply chain immunity perceptions that have not been used in the medical supply chain literature. This paper presents a first-of-a-kind scale for supply chain immunity perceptions utilizing nascent methods and demonstrates the constructs impact on vaccine program confidence and public willingness to participate.",International Journal of Logistics Management,2023-01-18,10.1108/IJLM-03-2022-0111
Unlocking Solver Potential: A Framework for Analysis and Inter-Comparison of Optimisation Solvers,"Linear and mixed integer optimisation problems have demonstrated their strength in the field of (healthcare) logistics and supply chain management for years. However, real-world optimisation problems are complex in nature, and various mathematical programming solvers are leveraged to solve these problems today. With several advances in solver technologies in recent years, there has been growing interest in carrying out comparative evaluations of solvers for a range of applications. However, there appears a lack of guidance for decision makers to conduct solver performance assessment and inter-comparison. To address this gap, we aim to derive a framework of parameters deemed most relevant for evaluating and comparing different solvers for a given application. To this end, we perform a systematic literature review. The resulting parameters are classified into three core categories: performance metrics, stopping conditions, and performance enhancing elements of a solver.","International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2023: ""Rising like a Phoenix: Emerging from the Pandemic and Reshaping Human Endeavors with Digital Technologies""",2023-01-01,

Study and Analysis of Discrete Event-Driven Autonomous System with a Case Study for a Robotics Task,"Highly probabilistic, potential, and dynamic domains are only relatively known to contribute classical techniques for complex system establishment impossible. Currently available technologies and strategies do not adequately address these novel needs. Thus, by enabling autonomous systems to adapt, decision-making and learning abilities, we can empower them with sufficient and appropriate expertise to recognize and address such issues. To address these requirements, discrete event-driven systems (DEDS) have been developed. This system can help the technologists of future autonomous systems by simulating the effect of auxiliary designs on the performance of the autonomous system. For modeling regular feedback of performance that is influenced by traditional techniques and depends on trust, the discrete event-driven method is most suited. This paper describes the DEDS system, the modeling of this system, and as well as the supervisory control system by explaining the supervisor, and partial supervisor. A comprehensive literature survey has been carried out in this article to explain the controllability, diagnosability, and observability potential of the DEDS system for various applications. Some of the major areas of applications such as healthcare, logistics, robotics, and banking sectors, have been discussed. Also, we have explained this system with the help of modeling a discrete event system for a queuing problem associated with robotics tasks as an example by the simulation with MATLAB 2022a. Lastly, the possible future research directions in the DEDS advancement have been provided.",Przeglad Elektrotechniczny,2023-01-01,10.15199/48.2023.09.09
Mobile healthcare service planning in rural areas: A hybrid record to record travel algorithm,"Due to the economic infeasibility of establishing comprehensive healthcare facilities in sparsely populated areas and the responsibility of governments to ensure equal healthcare access for citizens, different approaches have been sought in healthcare service delivery. The Republic of Turkiye's Ministry of Health provides mobile healthcare services (MHS) to 9 million people monthly through 3400 healthcare facilities and 7500 doctors. This study focuses on the Mobile Healthcare Service Routing and Scheduling Problem (MHS-RSP). The objective of MHS-RSP is to determine the daily routes of doctors on a monthly basis to minimize total distance traveled, taking into account constraints such as working hours, route time, minimum service time per visit, and dedicated doctor assignments to villages. A mixed-integer mathematical model is developed to address the problem, which is NP-hard and equivalent to the multi-depot time-constrained periodic vehicle routing problem. To solve medium- and large-sized problems efficiently, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm named ""GCH-RRT"" is introduced, based on greedy constructive heuristic(GCH) and record-to-record travel(RRT) metaheuristic. The performance of the mathematical model and the GCH-RRT algorithm is compared with existing service plans in Ankara, resulting in a 15.6% improvement with the mathematical model and a 22.3% improvement with the GCH-RRT algorithm in total distance traveled.",Journal of the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture of Gazi University,2023-01-01,10.17341/gazimmfd.1218090
Drivers and Barriers to Implementing the Internet of Things in the Health Care Supply Chain: Mixed Methods Multicase Study,"Background: Over the past 2 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed enormous pressure on the health care industry. There has been an increase in demand and, at the same time, a shortage of supplies. This has shown that supply chain management in the health care industry cannot be taken for granted. Furthermore, the health care industry is also facing other major challenges, such as the current labor market shortage. In the literature, the Internet of Things (IoT) is highlighted as an effective tool to build a more resilient and efficient supply chain that can manage these challenges. Although using IoT in supply chain management has been extensively examined in other types of supply chains, its use in the health care supply chain has largely been overlooked. Given that the health care supply chain, compared to others, is more complex and is under growing pressure, a more in-depth understanding of the opportunities brought by IoT is necessary. Objective: This study aims to address this research gap by identifying and ranking the drivers of and barriers to implementing IoT in the health care supply chain. Methods: We conducted a 2-stage study. In the first, exploratory stage, a total of 12 semistructured interviews were conducted to identify drivers and barriers. In the second, confirmatory stage, a total of 26 health care supply chain professionals were asked in a survey to rank the drivers and barriers. Results: The results show that there are multiple financial, operational, strategy-related, and supply chain-related drivers for implementing IoT. Similarly, there are various financial, strategy-related, supply chain-related, technology-related, and user-related barriers. The findings also show that supply chain-related drivers (eg, increased transparency, traceability, and collaboration with suppliers) are the strongest drivers, while financial barriers (eg, high implementation costs and difficulties in building a business case) are the biggest barriers to overcome. Conclusions: The findings of this study add to the limited literature regarding IoT in the health care supply chain by empirically identifying the most important drivers and barriers to IoT implementation. The ranking of drivers and barriers provides guidance for practitioners and health care provider leaders intending to implement IoT in the health care supply chain.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,2023-01-01,10.2196/48730

Future healthcare logistics: a survey of the public opinion on drones in Denmark,"Drones are expected to become widespread in society, making public readiness an important prerequisite for successfully unleashing them. This article investigates Danish citizens’ opinions on drones across varying fields of application and, specif-ically, six potential cases of healthcare logistics. Survey data representative of age, gender, and geography were collected and included information about respondents’ background, knowledge level of drones, and opinions on different drone use cases. Data were analysed with frequency tables and bivariate cross-tabulation. A thousand and four Danish adults completed the survey. Although other fields of application received higher levels of support, a majority of the respondents were positive towards using drones for healthcare logistics. Transportation of medicine and blood samples between hospitals were the most accepted healthcare use cases. Support varies across age with the highest support found in the eldest age group. Also, the more citizens report to know about drones, the more they tend to support using them. The results suggest that policymakers and firms must be attentive towards the public opinion on drones and seek insights into what citizens regard as noble purposes of using drones. Moreover, citizens must become more acquainted with drones, as this will likely boost public support.",Drone Systems and Applications,2023-01-01,10.1139/dsa-2022-0050
Transforming healthcare logistics and evaluating current use cases of UAVs (drones) as a method of transportation in healthcare to generate recommendations for the NHS to use drone technology at scale: a narrative review,"Drones have been pioneered and used in the military, however, only recently non-military drones have been introduced. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into focus the potential value of drones in moving medical supplies. With the onset of social distancing policies and quarantine regulations, the efficiency of traditional logistics systems has been limited. Several companies have recently accelerated their development in this domain, conducting pilot projects at pace, paving the way for the future of the medical logistics supply chain. In this review, we examine both narrative and grey literature for in and out of hospital settings, in order to describe the current state of drone technology in healthcare around the world and some of the most cutting-edge examples of how drones can benefits patients, clinicians and the wider public. We investigate the economic viability and barriers to adopting drones at scale which include regulatory hurdles, public perception and safety of drone technologies, and propose how to overcome these challenges. Further work should look at quantifying the impact and outcomes of how such a service could impact the health outcomes of patients and clinical efficiency. This review aims to equip the National Health Service and more broadly other healthcare systems around the world with the tools to embrace and implement this novel and upcoming technology.",BMJ Innovations,2023-01-01,10.1136/bmjinnov-2021-000861
Reorganisation of the internal storage and distribution logistics in a hospital,"This study involved the analysis and improvement of the internal distribution and storage at Hospital da Senhora da Oliveira - Guimaraes, a 500-beds general hospital in the north of Portugal. The study evolved around an action-research strategy that comprised five sequential and interconnected phases. Initially, the internal supply chain of the hospital was analysed with a special focus on ward warehouses (WW) and data about the logistics processes of the WW were gathered. Following, a prototype WW to test a set of innovative solutions aimed at dealing with the difficulties identified in the previous phase was developed. The proposed improvements were analysed and then implemented in the WW of a health care department, which lead to a new data collection about the performance of the logistics processes. The implementation of the proposed solutions resulted in a reduction of the time spent collecting, debiting and storing materials of 55% to 66%. It was also possible to reduce the error rate in these processes by 93%. When the proposed solutions are expanded to the whole hospital, in a year, it will be possible to save 4,819 hours in WW logistics processes (that can be dedicated to provide care to patients) and to avoid 115,843 errors",Procedia Computer Science,2023-01-01,10.1016/j.procs.2023.01.421
Robotics Systems and Healthcare Logistics,"Including waste management, warehousing, inventory management, equipment maintenance, sanitation, and transportation, healthcare logistics has focused on providing more innovative and value-added services in recent years. Therefore healthcare services should be examined and aligned with the objectives of the entire healthcare supply chain to meet the needs of both individuals and organizations. This will help to improve the supply chain performance so that reflects on the patient outcomes. Lack of efficient storage areas, increasing wages/salaries, and some activities that are conducted by healthcare employees manually are the priority areas that require solutions. According to studies in the field of health logistics, supply chain activities take more than the time spent on patient care. In addition, the logistics activities that have to be done manually by the health personnel leave a negative impression on the patients. Based on these, healthcare logistics should be improved in order to decrease the level of fatigue of healthcare personnel and create more time to interact with patients. Serving various tasks and purposes in many business sector, robots are preparing to become one of the most important technological innovations for healthcare industry. Nowadays, the robotics community is largely focused on developing the next generation of service and social robots. It is predicted that the use of robots in diagnostics, surgery, rehabilitation, patient care, disinfection and cleaning, medicine and food distribution, vital signs measurement, disease prevention, and disease management will increase performance in healthcare services. Among these, robots providing disinfection and logistics services are predicted to have the shortest-term impact.","Accounting, Finance, Sustainability, Governance and Fraud",2023-01-01,10.1007/978-981-99-1818-8_7

The Dial-a-Ride Problem with School Bell Time Adjustment,"In this paper, we study a paratransit application in which children are transported every day from their homes to their special schools or medical-social establishments. To optimize this transportation system, the establishments collaborate to propose a joint transportation plan. We propose a new algorithm to jointly build vehicle routes that visit several establishments and simultaneously set the establishments’ opening hours. This algorithm combines a large neighborhood search, the resolution of a route-based model, and the progressive shrinkage of the planning window. It is applied to a real case from the area of Lyon in France, including 34 schools and 575 heterogeneous users served by a heterogeneous fleet of reconfigurable vehicles. On average, we show that in addition to the 10% of saving that can be expected by sharing vehicle routes between schools, 7% of additional savings can be achieved by school bell adjustment. This cost saving also decreases average user ride times and the number of vehicles required, creating longer routes that are more attractive for driver services.",Transportation Science,2023-01-01,10.1287/trsc.2022.1160
Simheuristic and learnheuristic algorithms for the temporary-facility location and queuing problem during population treatment or testing events,"Epidemic outbreaks, such as the one generated by the coronavirus disease, have raised the need for more efficient healthcare logistics. One of the challenges that many governments have to face in such scenarios is the deployment of temporary medical facilities across a region with the purpose of providing medical services to their citizens. This work tackles this temporary-facility location and queuing problem with the goals of minimising costs, the expected completion time, population travel time, and waiting time. The completion time for a facility depends on the numbers assigned to those facilities as well as stochastic arrival times. This work proposes a learnheuristic algorithm to solve the facility location and population assignment problem. Firstly a machine learning algorithm is trained using data from a queuing model (simulation module). The learnheuristic then constructs solutions using the machine learning algorithm to rapidly evaluate decisions in terms of facility completion and population waiting times. The efficiency and quality of the algorithm is demonstrated by comparison with exact and simulation-only (simheuristic) methodologies. A series of experiments are performed which explore the trade-offs between solution cost, completion time, population travel time, and waiting time.",Journal of Simulation,2023-01-01,10.1080/17477778.2023.2166879

The impact of the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Australian trans community,"Background: Trans and gender diverse individuals (people who identify with a gender different to what was presumed for them at birth) are one of the most medically and socially marginalized groups in our community. The COVID-19 pandemic may compound preexisting depression and thoughts of self-harm or suicide. Aim: We aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Australian trans community. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted between 1st May 2020 and 30th June 2020, amidst strict Australia-wide social restrictions. Australian trans people aged ≥16 years were eligible to participate. Survey questions explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on living situation, employment, financial situation, and healthcare. Logistic regression to assess negative impacts due to COVID-19 on depression and thoughts of self-harm or suicide (measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) are presented as odds ratios (95% confidence interval)). Results: Of 1019 participants, 49.6% reported experiencing financial strain, 22% had reduced working hours, and 22.4% were unemployed (three times the national rate). Concerningly, 61.1% experienced clinically significant symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≥10), considerably higher than pre-COVID rates for the trans community and over twice the national rate. Moreover, 49% reported thoughts of self-harm or suicide (over three times the national rate) which was more likely if a person experienced cancelation or postponement of gender-affirming surgery (OR 1.56 (1.04, 2.35)), financial strain (OR 1.80 (1.36, 2.38)), or felt unsafe or afraid in their household (OR 1.96 (1.23, 3.08)). Discussion: Given rates of clinically significant depression and thoughts of self-harm or suicide are far higher in trans people than the general population, specific strategies to improve mental health in the trans community during the COVID-19 pandemic must be made a priority for policymakers, researchers, and health service providers to prevent suicide.

How important is income in explaining individuals having forgone healthcare due to cost-sharing payments? Results from a mixed methods sequential explanatory study,"Background: Patients having forgone healthcare because of the costs involved has become more prevalent in recent years. Certain patient characteristics, such as income, are known to be associated with a stronger demand-response to cost-sharing. In this study, we first assess the relative importance of patient characteristics with regard to having forgone healthcare due to cost-sharing payments, and then employ qualitative methods in order to understand these findings better. Methods: Survey data was collected from a Dutch panel of regular users of healthcare. Logistic regression models and dominance analyses were performed to assess the relative importance of patient characteristics, i.e., personal characteristics, health, educational level, sense of mastery and financial situation. Semi-structured interviews (n = 5) were conducted with those who had forgone healthcare. The verbatim transcribed interviews were thematically analyzed. Results: Of the 7,339 respondents who completed the questionnaire, 1,048 respondents (14.3%) had forgone healthcare because of the deductible requirement. The regression model indicated that having a higher income reduced the odds of having forgone recommended healthcare due to the deductible (odds ratios of higher income categories relative to the lowest income category (reference): 0.29–0.49). However, dominance analyses revealed that financial leeway was more important than income: financial leeway contributed the most (34.8%) to the model’s overall McFadden’s pseudo-R2 (i.e., 0.123), followed by income (25.6%). Similar results were observed in stratified models and in population weighted models. Qualitative analyses distinguished four main themes that affected the patient’s decision whether to use healthcare: financial barriers, structural barriers related to the complex design of cost-sharing programs, individual considerations of the patient, and the perceived lack of control regarding treatment choices within a given treatment trajectory. Furthermore, “having forgone healthcare” seemed to have a negative connotation. Conclusion: Our findings show that financial leeway is more important than income with respect to having forgone recommended healthcare due to cost-sharing payments, and that other factors such as the perceived necessity of healthcare also matter. Our findings imply that solely adapting cost-sharing programs to income levels will only get one so far. Our study underlines the need for a broader perspective in the design of cost-sharing programs.",BMC Health Services Research,2022-12-01,10.1186/s12913-022-07527-z

Cooperative Blood Inventory Ledger (CoBIL): A decentralized decision-making framework for improving blood product management,"Inefficiencies in blood product management systems, including segmented operations, lack of detailed data sharing, and limited real-time visibility, can often result in significant annual losses in product wastage and postponed medical procedures. Left unaddressed, the negative impact on patient health and healthcare systems can be substantial as blood donations continue to decline. This paper proposes the Cooperative Blood Inventory Ledger (CoBIL), a blockchain and smart-contract enabled system designed to mitigate some of these inefficiencies by increasing cooperation among all echelons of the blood supply chain, without sacrificing entity privacy and competition. The proposed framework facilitates collaborative decision-making among all stakeholders to distribute blood products across healthcare networks and reduce system costs. It also facilitates product redistribution among hospitals and other transfusion points to reduce losses due to expired product or canceled medical procedures due to product shortages. A role-based smart contract is included in the framework to define stakeholder access and manage data exchange. To analyze the feasibility of the proposed framework, we implement a proof of concept on a local machine using Hyperledger fabric's test network and employ it to simulate transactions required for the inventory operations of a regional blood supply chain.",Computers and Industrial Engineering,2022-10-01,10.1016/j.cie.2022.108571
The impact of counterfeit risk management on healthcare supply chain performance: an empirical analysis,"Purpose: This study develops and tests a model exploring the relationship between supply chain (SC) counterfeit risk management and performance in the healthcare supply chain (HCSC). Design/methodology/approach: In the proposed theoretical model, HCSC counterfeit risk management is characterized by HCSC counterfeit risk orientation (HCRO), HCSC counterfeit risk mitigation (HCRM) and HCSC risk management integration (HRMI), while performance is represented by healthcare logistics performance (HLP) and healthcare organization overall performance (HOP). Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and survey data from 55 HCSC managers are used to test the research hypotheses. Findings: HCRO has a significant positive effect on HCRM, while HCRM has a positive impact on HRMI. With respect to HLP, HCRM has a nonsignificant effect, while HRMI has a significant impact, thus confirming the important mediating role of HRMI. Finally, HLP has a significant positive effect on the overall performance of healthcare organizations. Research limitations/implications: All study participants were from the United States, limiting the generalizability of the study findings to different countries or regions. The sample size employed in the study did not allow the authors to distinguish among the different types of healthcare organizations. Originality/value: This study delineates between a healthcare organization's philosophy toward counterfeiting risks vs actions taken to eliminate or reduce the impact of counterfeiting on the HCSC. By offering firm-level guidance for managers, this study informs healthcare organizations about addressing the challenge of counterfeiting in the HCSC.",International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management,2022-08-16,10.1108/IJPPM-08-2020-0426
The multi-trip vehicle routing problem with increasing profits for the blood transportation: An iterated local search metaheuristic,"This paper studies a multi-trip routing problem of a shuttle fleet to transport blood units from collection sites to a blood center. In this problem, the blood units intended to produce platelets and cryoprecipitate must be processed within eight hours from their donation and arrive at the blood center at a time less than its closing time to guarantee enough processing time. Since it is assumed that blood units are donated at a collection site following a constant ratio over its operating hours, this problem is modeled as a multi-trip vehicle routing problem with increasing profits for which a mixed-integer linear programming formulation is proposed. A hybrid iterated local search metaheuristic and an extended version are developed as solution methods. The extended version includes a mixed-integer linear programming component into the local search of the hybrid metaheuristic to optimize the decision on the departure times of the trips.

"Prioritizing interdependent drivers of financial, economic, and political risks using a data-driven probabilistic approach","Financial, economic, and political risks pose a significant threat to the development and progress of countries as such risks can impact all spheres of life including education, healthcare, logistics, transportation, and safety among others. Although these risks seem quite distinct, they are mutually influenced by multidimensional interdependent factors such as internal and external conflict, socioeconomic conditions, corruption, law and order, and bureaucratic quality among others. In this paper, we utilize a data-driven approach to explore dependencies among factors influencing financial, economic, and political risks and establish their relative importance in a network setting while capturing the entire distribution of individual factors. A probabilistic network-based model was developed using the data by the International Country Risk Guide, which revealed significant differences between the conventional and the proposed schemes for prioritizing drivers of political, economic, and financial risks. Internal conflict and socioeconomic conditions were considered as the most critical factors in terms of reducing and enhancing the network-wide risk exposure, respectively. The two prioritization schemes relative to the vulnerability and resilience impact of individual factors are not correlated and therefore, policy-makers need to focus on both schemes while developing risk mitigation strategies.",Risk Management,2022-06-01,10.1057/s41283-022-00089-8
Fleet sizing and routing of healthcare automated guided vehicles,"This paper proposes techniques to improve the efficiency of transportation activities within hospitals. Transportation is a major activity in hospitals which requires management efforts to improve its efficiency and increase the quality of patient services. One of the most powerful ways of achieving more efficiency of transportation systems in hospitals is via the labor-saving technology of logistics processes using automated guided vehicles (AGVs). In this paper, we study the fleet sizing and routing problem with synchronization for AGVs with dynamic demands (FSRPS-AGV) in the context of a real-life application. The goal is to simultaneously optimize the number and types of carts and AGVs needed to perform all daily requests in a hospital while optimizing AGVs’ routes and respecting time constraints. Different requests require different types of carts, which are transported by the AGVs. Each request is composed of several tasks consisting of moving material from a pickup point to a delivery point. Operation synchronization among the tasks of the same request (task 1 must be performed before task 2, possibly by different AGVs but using the same cart) and movement synchronization with respect to AGVs and carts (an AGV may drop off a cart, and later another AGV picks up the cart to continue serving the same or another request) are major challenges of the addressed problem. In this paper, we describe, model, and solve the FSRPS-AGV. We introduce a mathematical formulation and propose a powerful matheuristic based on a fast and efficient dynamic reoptimization of the routes upon the arrival of new requests. We compare the performance of our matheuristic under different scenarios, including against the solutions obtained by an oracle, showing that it can handle dynamism of demand very well and achieve near-optimal solutions. We assess our methods using small and large instances generated based on real data from an industrial partner. We demonstrate that significant performance improvements and important savings can be achieved with a small degree of flexibility in timing constraints and less conservative speed estimations (while taking into account safety concerns). Finally, we provide managerial insights with respect to the number of AGVs and carts that should be acquired by our industrial partner.",Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,2022-05-01,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102679
Optimal Multikey Homomorphic Encryption with Steganography Approach for Multimedia Security in Internet of Everything Environment,"Recent developments of semiconductor and communication technologies have resulted in the interconnection of numerous devices in offering seamless communication and services, which is termed as Internet of Everything (IoE). It is a subset of Internet of Things (IoT) which finds helpful in several applications namely smart city, smart home, precise agriculture, healthcare, logistics, etc. Despite the benefits of IoE, it is limited to processing and storage abilities, resulting in the degrada-tion of device safety, privacy, and efficiency. Security and privacy become major concerns in the transmission of multimedia data over the IoE network. Encryption and image steganography is considered effective solutions to accomplish secure data transmission in the IoE environment. For resolving the limitations of the existing works, this article proposes an optimal multikey homomorphic encryption with steganography approach for multimedia security (OMKHES‐MS) technique in the IoE environment. Primarily, singular value decomposition (SVD) model is applied for the separation of cover images into RGB elements. Besides, optimum pixel selection process is carried out using coyote optimization algorithm (COA). At the same time, the encryption of secret images is performed using poor and rich optimization (PRO) with multikey homomorphic encryption (MKHE) technique. Finally, the cipher image is embedded into the chosen pixel values of the cover image to generate stego image.

Sustainable and Robust Home Healthcare Logistics: A Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Today, research on healthcare logistics is an important challenge in developing and developed countries, especially when a pandemic such as COVID-19 occurs. The responses required during such a pandemic would benefit from an efficiently designed model for robust and sustainable healthcare logistics. In this study, we focus on home healthcare logistics and services for planning the routing and scheduling of caregivers to visit patients’ homes. Due to the need for social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, these services are highly applicable for reducing the growth of the epidemic. In addition to this challenge, home healthcare logistics and services must be redesigned to meet the standards of a triple bottom line approach based on sustainable development goals. A triple bottom line approach finds a balance between economic, environmental, and social criteria for making a sustainable decision. Although, recently, the concept of green home healthcare has been studied based on the total cost and green emissions of home healthcare logistics and services, as far as we know, no research has been conducted on the formulation of a triple bottom line approach for home healthcare logistics and services. To achieve social justice for caregivers, the goal of balancing working time is to find a balance between unemployment time and overtime. Another contribution of this research is to develop a scenario-based robust optimization approach to address the uncertainty of home healthcare logistics and services and to assist with making robust decisions for home healthcare planning. Since our multi-objective optimization model for sustainable and robust home healthcare logistics and services is more complex than other studies, the last novel contribution of this research is to establish an efficient heuristic algorithm based on the Lagrangian relaxation theory. An initial solution is found by defining three heuristic algorithms. Our heuristic algorithms use a symmetric pattern for allocating patients to pharmacies and planning the routing of caregivers. Then, a combination of the epsilon constraint method and the Lagrangian relaxation theory is proposed to generate high-quality Pareto-based solutions in a reasonable time period. Finally, an extensive analysis is done to show that our multi-objective optimization model and proposed heuristic algorithm are efficient and practical, as well as some sensitivities are studied to provide some managerial insights for achieving sustainable and robust home healthcare services in practice.",Symmetry,2022-02-01,10.3390/sym14020193
Improved renal cancer prognosis among users of drugs targeting renin-angiotensin system,"Purpose: We explored renal cell cancer (RCC) survival among users of antihypertensive medication as hypertension is proposed to be a risk factor for RCC and ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been associated with improved prognosis of RCC. Methods: Finnish cohort of 13,873 participants with RCC diagnosed between 1995–2012 was formed from three national databases. RCC cases were identified from Finnish Cancer Registry, medication usage from national prescription database and co-morbidities from Care Registry of Healthcare. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for metastatic tumor extent at the time of diagnosis. Risk of RCC specific death after diagnosis was analyzed using Cox regression adjusted for tumor clinical characteristics. Results: A total of 5,179 participants died of RCC during the follow-up. No risk association was found for metastatic tumor extent for any drug group. ACE-inhibitors, but no other drug group were associated with decreased risk of RCC specific death overall (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82–0.95) compared to non-users. In time-dependent analysis high-dose use of ACE-inhibitors (392 Defined Daily Dose (DDD)/year), HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.45–0.66) and ARBs (786.1 DDD/year, HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50–0.87) associated with improved RCC survival. No information of TNM-classification or tobacco smoking was available. Conclusion: ACE-inhibitors and ARBs in high dose associated with improved RCC specific survival. This may reflect overall benefit of treating hypertension with medication targeting renin-angiotensin system (RAS) system among RCC patients. Further studies are needed to explore the role of RAS in RCC.",Cancer Causes and Control,2022-02-01,10.1007/s10552-021-01527-w
Hospital-Location Classification and Analysis in the Healthcare Cold Chain using K-means Algorithm,"Logistics and supply chain management for the healthcare sector is concerned with activities related to production, storage, and distribution. Relevant stakeholders are from various parties, which are inclusive of material supplier, manufacturer, distribution center, regional hospital, provincial hospital, as well as patients. In this research, we analyze the locational data of hospital using a case study of hospitals in Thailand to evaluate potential locational center acting as a central storage and distribution centers. Initially, we apply the K-means algorithm to classify hospital locational data into a specified number of classification groups. Then, the location model based on rectilinear distance is formulated and minimized to evaluate potential locations for the central storage and distribution centers.

DEEP LEARNING FOR THE PREDICTION OF TRANS-BORDER LOGISTICS OF PATIENTS TO MEDICAL CENTERS,"Background: Covid 19 impacted many healthcare logistics systems. An enormous number of people suffer from the effect of a pandemic, infection diseases can spread rapidly within and between countries. People from the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Lao People's Democratic Republic are most likely to cross-border into Thailand for diagnosis and special treatment. In this situation, international referral cannot predict the volume of patients and their destination. Therefore, the aim of the research is to use deep learning to construct a model that predicts the travel demand of patients at the border. Methods: Based on previous emergency medical services, the prediction demand used the gravity model or the regression model. The novelty element in this research paper uses the neural network technique. In this study, a two-stage survey is used to collect data. The first phase interviews experts from the strategic group level of The Public Health Office. The second phase examines the patient?s behavior regarding route selection using a survey. The methodology uses deep learning training using the Sigmoid function and Identity function. The statistics of precision include the average percent relative error (APRE), the root mean square error (RMSE), the standard deviation (SD), and the correlation coefficient (R). Results: Deep learning is suitable for complex problems as a network. The model allows the different data sets to forecast the demand for the cross-border patient for each hospital. Equations are applied to forecast demand, in which the different hospitals require a total of 58,000 patients per year to be diagnosed by the different hospitals. The predictor performs better than the RBF and regression model. Conclusions: The novelty element of this research uses the deep learning technique as an efficient nonlinear model; moreover, it is suitable for dynamic prediction. The main advantage is to apply this model to predict the number of patients, which is the key to determining the supply chain of treatment; additionally, the ability to formulate guidelines with healthcare logistics effectively in the future.",Logforum,2022-01-01,10.17270/J.LOG.2022.689
Artificial Intelligence for Smart Cities: Locational Planning and Dynamic Routing of Emergency Vehicles,"To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of essential emergency services such as ambulances, fire brigades, and police, one of the most important problems to tackle is to minimize the response times of these emergency vehicles. As well as attaining optimal waiting sites and deployment strategies for the emergency vehicles, the optimal routing and traffic preemption of the vehicles are also crucial in minimizing response times and maximizing coverage. As locational planning and dynamic routing of the emergency vehicles relate to many different situations with varying emergency levels, they are a crucial part of the smart city concept. In this chapter, we present a perspective for the use of artificial intelligence and optimization in sustainable healthcare logistics within a smart city. We provide a survey of literature and identify many applications from around the globe. Related mathematical models and solution approaches are also presented, as necessary.","Accounting, Finance, Sustainability, Governance and Fraud",2022-01-01,10.1007/978-981-16-8997-0_3
A Locational Analysis Model of the COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution,"Even and equitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine becomes one of key strategies to reduce the number of positive cases and virus transmissions all over the world. This paper aims to introduce and demonstrate a mathematical model based on a maximal covering location problem (MCLP) to optimise the coverage of the COVID-19 vaccine distribution. A mathematical model is proposed and demonstrated using an illustrative case study of healthcare facilities and location coordinates of villages in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. A numerical computer experiment is conducted to obtain optimal results of the locational analysis. The results show that the proposed model provides an efficient coverage of vaccination by minimising the distances travelled by the target population. It also reveals an interesting insight that prioritising vaccination for areas with high COVID-19 cases results in a less efficient coverage. The novel location-allocation model for COVID-19 vaccination facilities proposed in this paper particularly applies in a developing country. The model could be used as an alternative way to increase the vaccination coverage and priority whilst minimising the potential risks of the virus transmissions and transport costs.",Operations and Supply Chain Management,2022-01-01,10.31387/oscm0490344
Request and Donation Efficiencies in a Crisis: Data Envelopment Analyses of a Philippine Web-Based Emergency Response System,"On March 16, 2020, the island of Luzon was placed under lockdown to curtail the spread of COVID-19 in the Philippines. Soon thereafter, a web-based emergency response platform was developed to counteract effects from the outbreak. As a free service to strengthen a debilitated national hospital supply chain, the platform connected community organizations (as hospitals) with donors (individuals). From concepts and techniques that addressed information flows in healthcare logistics and supply chain management, several input-oriented data envelopment analyses were conducted to find the efficiencies for each of the 75 hospitals serviced by the website in terms of donors, individual items requested, total quantity of items requested, number of requested individual items that received a pledged, and average days a request pended to fulfillment. Results from the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique found that hospitals on the platform made requests that exceeded optimal quantities of inputs from donors. Further, hospital requests aggregated at the city-level stood unanswered an average of 14.39 days for inefficiently served cities. Findings from the analyses produced three recommendations to improve the web-based emergency response system service efficiency. The first recommendation was to reallocate donors over more hospitals, such that a few hospitals did not receive a majority of donations. A second recommendation was to reduce the number of individually requested items. The third recommendation was to reduce the quantities of items requested in order to bring service efficiency to optimality.",Contributions to Economics,2022-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-89996-7_20
Coordinating inventory sharing with retailer's return in the consignment contracts,"Hospitals purchase medical supplies from the dealer on consignment contracts. Dealer provides a return policy for unused inventory but charging a return fee. Two hospitals could share inventory which reduces the amount of return to the dealer. Motivated by this consignment contract policy for the medical supply chain, we develop a common dealer and two independent retailers framework that considers retailers' sharing action and return problem. We aim at developing a coordinating mechanism to manage the retailers' sharing and return action that benefits both the dealer and retailers. Dealer-dominated sharing and retailer-dominated sharing are compared from the perspective of sharing performance and expected profits. We also analyse the condition that the dealer is better off from retailers' sharing when the dealer has the power to encourage retailers' sharing, and the dealer's trading preference for a non-cooperative retailer or cooperative retailers when the dealer has no power to encourage retailers' sharing. Numerical experiments are conducted to examine the sensitivity of retailers' sharing decisions, retailers' and dealer's profit to the return price.",International Journal of Production Research,2022-01-01,10.1080/00207543.2020.1854485
Non-medical barriers in access to early steps of kidney transplantation in the United States – A scoping review,"Background: In the United States (US), barriers in access to later steps in the kidney transplantation process (i.e. waitlisting) have been well documented. Barriers in access to earlier steps (i.e. referral and evaluation) are less well described due to the lack of national surveillance data. In this review, we summarize the available literature on non-medical barriers in access to kidney transplant referral and evaluation. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a scoping review of the literature through June 3, 2021. We included all studies (quantitative and qualitative) reporting on barriers to kidney transplant referral and evaluation in the US published from 1990 onwards in English and among adult end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42014015027). We narratively synthesized results across studies. Results: We retrieved information from 33 studies published from 1990 to 2021 (reporting data between 1990 and 2018). Most studies (n = 28, 85%) described barriers among patient populations, three (9%) among provider populations, and two (6%) included both patients and providers. Key barriers were identified across multiple levels and included patient- (e.g. demographic, socioeconomic, sociocultural, and knowledge), provider- (e.g. miscommunication, staff availability, provider perceptions and attitudes), and system- (e.g. geography, distance to care, healthcare logistics) level factors. Conclusions: A multi-pronged approach (e.g. targeted and systemwide interventions, and policy change) implemented at multiple levels of the healthcare system will be necessary to reduce identified barriers in access to early kidney transplant steps. Collection of national surveillance data on these early kidney transplant steps is also needed to enhance our understanding of barriers to referral and evaluation.",Transplantation Reviews,2021-12-01,10.1016/j.trre.2021.100654
"Logistics for a fleet of drones for medical item delivery: A case study for Louisville, KY","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, commonly referred to as drones, have been widely acknowledged as a promising technology for the delivery of medical and aid packages in humanitarian and healthcare logistics. In this study, we develop an optimization model to optimize the logistics for a fleet of drones for timely delivery of medical items (e.g., medicines, test kits, and vaccines) to hard-to-access locations (i.e., rural and suburban areas). We propose a novel timeslot formulation that schedules and sequences a set of trips to serve several demand locations. On each trip, a drone starts from an urban provider, visits one or more charging platforms (if required), serves a clinic in rural or suburban areas, and returns to the corresponding provider. The problem consists of selecting locations for charging stations, assigning clinics to providers, and scheduling and sequencing the trips such that the total completion time to serve all demand points is minimized. To improve the computational efficiency of the solution method, we use a preprocessing procedure to reduce the solution space by eliminating the dominated trips from the pool of trips. A set of numerical experiments is performed on simulated instances and on a case study in Louisville, KY. The results unveil interesting insights into the logistics of the proposed drone delivery system.",Computers and Operations Research,2021-11-01,10.1016/j.cor.2021.105443
Socio-economic and corporate factors and COVID-19 pandemic: a wake-up call,"The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) emerges from the Chinese city Wuhan and its spread to the rest of the world, primarily affected economies and their businesses, leading to a global depression. The explanatory and cross-sectional regression approach assesses the impact of COVID-19 cases on healthcare expenditures, logistics performance index, carbon damages, and corporate social responsibility in a panel of 77 countries. The results show that COVID-19 cases substantially increase healthcare expenditures and decrease corporate social responsibility. On the other hand, an increase in the coronavirus testing capacity brings positive change in reducing healthcare expenditures, increased logistics activities, and corporate social responsibility. The cost of carbon emissions increases when corporate activities begin to resume. The economic affluence supports logistics activities and improves healthcare infrastructure.

Six-Sigma Quality Management of Additive Manufacturing,"Quality is a key determinant in deploying new processes, products, or services and influences the adoption of emerging manufacturing technologies. The advent of additive manufacturing (AM) as a manufacturing process has the potential to revolutionize a host of enterprise-related functions from production to the supply chain. The unprecedented level of design flexibility and expanded functionality offered by AM, coupled with greatly reduced lead times, can potentially pave the way for mass customization. However, widespread application of AM is currently hampered by technical challenges in process repeatability and quality management. The breakthrough effect of six sigma (6S) has been demonstrated in traditional manufacturing industries (e.g., semiconductor and automotive industries) in the context of quality planning, control, and improvement through the intensive use of data, statistics, and optimization. 6S entails a data-driven DMAIC methodology of five steps - define, measure, analyze, improve, and control. Notwithstanding the sustained successes of the 6S knowledge body in a variety of established industries ranging from manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, and beyond, there is a dearth of concentrated application of 6S quality management approaches in the context of AM. In this article, we propose to design, develop, and implement the new DMAIC methodology for the 6S quality management of AM. First, we define the specific quality challenges arising from AM layerwise fabrication and mass customization (even one-of-a-kind production). Second, we present a review of AM metrology and sensing techniques, from materials through design, process, and environment, to postbuild inspection. Third, we contextualize a framework for realizing the full potential of data from AM systems and emphasize the need for analytical methods and tools. We propose and delineate the utility of new data-driven analytical methods, including deep learning, machine learning, and network science, to characterize and model the interrelationships between engineering design, machine setting, process variability, and final build quality. Fourth, we present the methodologies of ontology analytics, design of experiments (DOE), and simulation analysis for AM system improvements. In closing, new process control approaches are discussed to optimize the action plans, once an anomaly is detected, with specific consideration of lead time and energy consumption. We posit that this work will catalyze more in-depth investigations and multidisciplinary research efforts to accelerate the application of 6S quality management in AM.",Proceedings of the IEEE,2021-04-01,10.1109/JPROC.2020.3034519

Early Determinants of Length of Hospital Stay: A Case Control Survival Analysis among COVID-19 Patients admitted in a Tertiary Healthcare Facility of East India,"Background: Length of hospital stay (LOS) for a disease is a vital estimate for healthcare logistics planning. The study aimed to illustrate the effect of factors elicited on arrival on LOS of the COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: It was a retrospective, record based, unmatched, case control study using hospital records of 334 COVID-19 patients admitted in an East Indian tertiary healthcare facility during May to October 2020. Discharge from the hospital (cases/survivors) was considered as an event while death (control/non-survivors) as right censoring in the case-control survival analysis using cox proportional hazard model. Results: Overall, we found the median LOS for the survivors to be 8 days [interquartile range (IQR): 7-10 days] while the same for the non-survivors was 6 days [IQR: 2-11 days]. In the multivariable cox-proportional hazard model; travel distance (>16 km) [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 0.69, 95% CI: (0.50-0.95)], mode of transport to the hospital (ambulance) [aHR: 0.62, 95% CI: (0.45-0.85)], breathlessness (yes) [aHR: 0.56, 95% CI: (0.40-0.77)], number of co-morbidities (1-2) [aHR: 0.66, 95% CI: (0.47-0.93)] (≥3) [aHR: 0.16, 95% CI: (0.04-0.65)], COPD/asthma (yes) [[aHR: 0.11, 95% CI: (0.01-0.79)], DBP (<60/≥90) [aHR: 0.55, 95% CI: (0.35-0.86)] and qSOFA score (≥2) [aHR: 0.33, 95% CI: (0.12-0.92)] were the significant attributes affecting LOS of the COVID-19 patients.

A Mobile Healthcare Service Routing and Scheduling Problem in Rural Areas,"A change in health policy become essential since healthcare needs of societies have changed over the past sixty years. It is not possible to build a hospital wherever people live especially in less populated settlements. However, equal access of people to health services must be ensured by governments. To tackle this issue, Turkey Ministry of Health has enforced to give mobile healthcare services in rural areas by approximately 7.5 thousand doctors located in 3.4 thousand medical centers. These doctors work 8 h/day and give mobile healthcare service to approximately 9 million people each month. This study considers Turkey rural healthcare delivery system as a Multi-depot Time Constrained Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem (md-TCPVRP) and presents a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the problem. The goal is to derive daily routes of the doctors each month, under some constraints such as maximum workhours, route duration, minimum service time per visit, assigning dedicated doctors to villages while minimizing the total route distance.

Hybrid Intelligent System for Medical Diagnosis in Health Care,"The autonomous city implies a global vision that incorporates artificial intelligence, deep learning, big data, decision-making, ICT and the Internet of Things (IoT) to promote sustainable development. The ageing issue is that researchers, companies and the government should devote efforts to developing smart health care, innovative technology and applications. For an extended period, conventional intelligence systems have played a critical role in health care. However, with the increased popularity and widespread use of these hybrid intelligent computer systems, there is a significant shift in the healthcare sector. Diagnosis and detection of various diseases using several techniques can be resolved by using these techniques. Different novel methods are applied to biomedical engineering to diagnose diseases, and new models are being studied and compared with the existing technologies. Hybrid intelligence systems can be implied in decision-making, remote monitoring, healthcare logistics, medical diagnosis, and modern information system. This success's fundamental cause seems to be derived by different intelligent computational mechanisms, such as genetic algorithms, evolutionary computation, convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), autoencoders, deep generative models and deep belief networks. To solve complex problems, we need domain knowledge that comprises the methodologies that provide hybrid systems with complementary reasoning and empirical data.

Healthcare Logistics Optimization Framework for Efficient Supply Chain Management in Niger Delta Region of Nigeria,"Optimizing logistics allocation and utilization is essential for effective healthcare management. Apparently, less consideration is given to it in most hospitals in Nigeria where less resources are allocated to health sector in yearly budgetary. Hospital consists of several patient classes, each of which follows different treatment process flow paths over a multiphase and multidimensional requirement with scarce resources and inadequate space. Despite the small budget provision made for healthcare resources, patient’s demands for better service is rapidly experiencing upsurge. Hence, efficient and optimal solutions are required to lessen costs of healthcare service towards enhancing Quality of Care (QoC) and Quality of Experience (QoE) in most public healthcare sector. However, certain control coefficients like the absence of a Dedicated Logistics Department (DLD) in the medical facilities actually limit the efforts of stakeholders. This paper proposed a Computational framework to assess various strategic and operational decisions for optimizing the multiple objectives using Type-1 Fuzzy Logic Model. In phase I, we explore healthcare resource allocation plan. In phase II, we determine a resource utilization schedule by patient class for daily operational level. While in Phase III, we develop a framework capable of evaluating and optimizing healthcare logistics using control coefficients of Logistics Optimization (LO), Integration of Information/Cognitive Technologies (ETA), and Collaboration of all Logistics Stakeholders (COL). We assigned weights between 1 and 10 to the coefficients and modeled the effects on efficient supply chain. Finally, we further explore the effects of separate strategies and their combination to identify the best possible resource supply chain. The computational experiment was considered on the basis of data obtained from a study conducted on a typical public healthcare department. Results shows that our approach significantly evaluate and optimized healthcare logistics.",International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,2021-01-01,10.14569/IJACSA.2021.0120475
Transporting COVID-19 testing specimens by routing unmanned aerial vehicles with range and payload constraints: the case of Istanbul,"This paper aims to emphasize the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic at the healthcare logistics and supply chain networks and to transport polymerase chain reaction testing samples between hospitals and laboratories by using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). To achieve the mission, range and payload capacitated UAV routing problem is defined and a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP) is developed. The MILP model aims to decide the requisite quantity of the UAVs and to minimize the total transportation distance while satisfying the predetermined constraints. As a real-life instance, the healthcare network of Istanbul is selected and the network includes 219 hospitals and 23-unit basic testing laboratories for the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicated that the proposed optimization model can find the needed number of UAVs with the minimum tour distances in reasonable run times and achieves to transport 25,000 testing specimens between hospitals and laboratories via UAVs.",Transportation Letters,2021-01-01,10.1080/19427867.2021.1896063

An iterated local search for the biomedical sample transportation problem with multiple and interdependent pickups,"This article addresses a new version of the biomedical sample transportation problem, as a vehicle routing problem with precedence constraints arising in the context of healthcare logistics, and proposes an iterated local search algorithm to solve it. This new version is more realistic and complex since it considers the collection centres’ opening hours and the moment at which they are visited as decision variables, granting additional flexibility to elaborate more efficient routes. Indeed, this problem is harder to model and to solve than its previous version because the constraint on the short samples’ lifetime leads to interdependency between successive pickups at each collection center. A metaheuristic is thus proposed to solve real-life instances. Numerical experiments confirm (1) the value of simultaneously planning routes, opening hours, and visit hours (which is new in the literature) and (2) the efficiency of the proposed algorithm to solve this problem.",Journal of the Operational Research Society,2021-01-01,10.1080/01605682.2019.1657369
A multi-agents system for solving facility layout problem: Application to operating theater,"Facility layout problem (FLP) has a great impact on the efficiency of any organization. It is concerned with defining the optimal location for each facility in order to optimize the supply chain productivity. In this kind of problems, the choice of resolution approach depends on the complexity and the size of the problem. Operating theaters are generally big structures containing a lot of facilities, which makes the conception of their layout a complex problem. In the literature, exact methods are powerless when faced with problem sizes up to 18 facilities. This leads us to explore other approaches, looking for efficient solutions. This paper presents a novel approach using a multi-agents system where agents' skills are exploited to cover a wide research space, to accelerate the decision-making process and to deal with real-life problem sizes. This decision-making tool is based on several mixed integer linear programming models for solving the FLP, and considers two types of environments with deterministic and variant patient demand. Several experiments have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and several problem instances with >80 facilities have been solved in reasonable time.",Journal of Intelligent Systems,2021-01-01,10.1515/jisys-2017-0081
Implementation of a new echocardiographic practice during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Due to the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, healthcare logistics have changed abruptly and significantly in all medical specialties, of which cardiovascular services are no exception. Assessment of urgent and priority cases did not stop, both medical personnel and patients required adaptation of personal protective measures to prevent the spread of a highly contagious and potentially fatal virus for this vulnerable population with cardiovascular disease. In the time that has elapsed since the beginning of said pandemic to date, the health sector has become immersed in a fortuitous and challenging situation for its work environment. Considering that this virus could remain endemic, it is necessary to devise a protocol for a gradual and safe reincorporation of services at all levels of care. This document provides an update on recommendations for the return to a safe but no less efficient echocardiographic practice, based on expert opinions, some international guidelines along with evidence available until recently on several main echocardiographic findings in patients with cardiovascular disease by COVID-19, providing a general approach that can be adapted to the guidelines of each health institution in this country.",Cardiovascular and Metabolic Science,2020-10-01,10.35366/97548
A healthcare logistic network considering stochastic emission of contamination: Bi-objective model and solution algorithm,"This paper presents a novel healthcare waste location-routing problem by concentrating on a new perspective in healthcare logistics networks. In this problem, there are healthcare, treatment, and disposal centers. Locations of healthcare centers are known, however, it is required to select appropriate locations for treatment, recycling, and disposal centers. Healthcare wastes are divided into infectious and non-infectious wastes. Since a great volume of healthcare wastes are infectious, the emission of contamination can have obnoxious impacts on the environment. The proposed problem considers a stochastic essence for the emission of contamination which depends on the transferring times. In this respect, transferring times between healthcare and treatment centers have been considered as normal random variables. As transferring time increases, it is more likely for the contamination to spread. Having visited a treatment center, infectious wastes are sterilized and they will no longer be harmful to the environment. This research develops a bi-objective mixed-integer mathematical formulation to tackle this problem. The objectives of this model are minimization of total costs and emission of contamination, simultaneously. Complexity of the proposed problem led the researchers to another contribution. This study also develops a Multi-Objective Water-Flow like Algorithm (MOWFA), which is a meta-heuristic, to solve the problem. This algorithm uses a procedure based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to rank the non-dominated solutions in the archive set. By means of a developed mating operator, the MOWFA utilizes the best ranked solutions of the archive in order to obtain high quality offspring. Two neighborhood operators have been designed for the MOWFA as the local search methods. Extensive computational experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the MOWFA on several test problems compared with other meta-heuristics, namely the Multi-Objective Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (MOICA) and Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA). These experiments also include a real healthcare waste logistic network in Iran. The computational experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm prevails these algorithms in terms of some well-known performance evaluation measures.",Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,2020-10-01,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102060
Support of the logistics chain by small aircraft in times of emergency,"Healthcare logistics, which is primarily aimed at patient care, represents a number of activities in the area of supply chain management. Hospitals are a key link in the supply chain, where they are the end customer, the supply chain from the manufacturer through all bottlenecks. A complete description of the distribution of medical supplies can be summarized into an external and internal supply chain. The external circuit represents the supply of the necessary commodities and ends at the distribution point. The internal circuit continues to the nursing units of the hospital supply chain. Currently, two basic forms are used for the distribution of supplies to the level of nursing units, through the regions, or through the supply from the humanitarian warehouse. The acquisition, storage, and distribution processes depend on the material availability on the market and the level of the maintained stocks. Modern technologies enable continuous collection of requirements and are the basis of a proactive approach to the solution, which allows the use of all accessible air transport, military and civilian capabilities, according to the criteria of the user or end customer.","NTinAD 2020 - New Trends in Aviation Development 2020 - 15th International Scientific Conference, Proceedings",2020-09-17,10.1109/NTAD51447.2020.9379077
Insights before flights: How community perceptions can make or break medical drone deliveries,"Drones are increasingly used to transport health products, but life-saving interventions can be stalled if local community concerns and preferences are not assessed and addressed. In order to inform the introduction of drones in new contexts, this paper analyzed similarities and differences in community perceptions of medical delivery drones in Malawi, Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Dominican Republic (DR). Community perceptions were assessed using focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) conducted with stakeholders at the national level, at health facilities and in communities. Data were collected on respondents’ familiarity with drones, perceptions of benefits and risks of drones, advice on drone operations and recommendations on sharing information with the community. The comparative analysis found similar perceptions around the potential benefits of using drones, as well as important differences in the perceived risks of flying drones and culturally appropriate communication mechanisms based on the local context. Because community perceptions are heavily influenced by culture and local experiences, a similar assessment should be conducted before introducing drone activities in new areas and two-way feedback channels should be established once drone operations are established in an area. The extent to which a community understands and supports the use of drones to transport health products will ultimately play a critical role in the success or failure of the drone’s ability to bring life-saving products to those who need them.",Drones,2020-09-01,10.3390/drones4030051
"Healthcare commodities for emergencies in Africa: review of logistics models, suggested model and research agenda","Purpose: Enormous numbers of people suffer from the effects of disasters and humanitarian crises in Africa, including medical and healthcare emergencies.

ONLINE CAPACITY PLANNING for REHABILITATION TREATMENTS: AN APPROXIMATE DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING APPROACH,"We study an online capacity planning problem in which arriving patients require a series of appointments at several departments, within a certain access time target. This research is motivated by a study of rehabilitation planning practices at the Sint Maartenskliniek hospital (the Netherlands). In practice, the prescribed treatments and activities are typically booked starting in the first available week, leaving no space for urgent patients who require a series of appointments at a short notice. This leads to the rescheduling of appointments or long access times for urgent patients, which has a negative effect on the quality of care and on patient satisfaction. We propose an approach for allocating capacity to patients at the moment of their arrival, in such a way that the total number of requests booked within their corresponding access time targets is maximized. The model considers online decision making regarding multi-priority, multi-appointment, and multi-resource capacity allocation. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that takes into account the current patient schedule, and future arrivals. We develop an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to obtain approximate optimal capacity allocation policies. We provide insights into the characteristics of the optimal policies and evaluate the performance of the resulting policies using simulation.",Probability in the Engineering and Informational Sciences,2020-07-01,10.1017/S0269964818000402
Association of open communication and the emotional and behavioural impact of medical error on patients and families: state-wide cross-sectional survey,"Background How openly healthcare providers communicate after a medical error may influence long-term impacts. We sought to understand whether greater open communication is associated with fewer persisting emotional impacts, healthcare avoidance and loss of trust. Methods Cross-sectional 2018 recontact survey assessing experience with medical error in a 2017 random digit dial survey of Massachusetts residents. Two hundred and fifty-three respondents self-reported medical error. Respondents were similar to non-respondents in sociodemographics confirming minimal response bias. Time since error was categorised as <1, 1–2 or 3–6 years before interview. Open communication was measured with six questions assessing different communication elements. Persistent impacts included emotional (eg, sadness, anger), healthcare avoidance (specific providers or all medical care) and loss of trust in healthcare. Logistic regressions examined the association between open communication and long-term impacts. Results Of respondents self-reporting a medical error 3–6 years ago, 51% reported at least one current emotional impact; 57% reported avoiding doctor/facilities involved in error; 67% reported loss of trust. Open communication varied: 34% reported no communication and 24% reported ≥5 elements. Controlling for error severity, respondents reporting the most open communication had significantly lower odds of persisting sadness (OR=0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.60, p=0.006), depression (OR=0.16, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.77, p=0.022) or feeling abandoned/betrayed (OR=0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.48, p=0.004) compared with respondents reporting no communication. Open communication significantly predicted less doctor/facility avoidance, but was not associated with medical care avoidance or healthcare trust. Conclusions Negative emotional impacts from medical error can persist for years. Open communication is associated with reduced emotional impacts and decreased avoidance of doctors/facilities involved in the error. Communication and resolution programmes could facilitate transparent conversations and reduce some of the negative impacts of medical error.",BMJ Quality and Safety,2020-01-20,10.1136/bmjqs-2019-010367

"Enterprise IoT Modeling: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning","The Internet of Things (IoT)—the internetworking of physical devices—has been a significant advancement in recent decades and has been the catalyst for several other innovations. New Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platforms aim to solve the most complex challenge of manufacturers: consolidating all production systems into a single data model. They are used in smart cities, security and emergencies, environmental applications, energy, healthcare, logistics, industrial control, home automation, agriculture, and animal farming. These objects/devices/appliances can generate, collect, and exchange data without human-to-human or human-to-computer interactions. The IIoT is creating an explosion in structured and unstructured data from a growing army of sensors capable of registering locations, voices, faces, audio, temperature, sentiment, health, and others. Billions of IoT devices are interconnected and a huge volume of data is generated. Every device features automation to assist people in the planning, management, and decision-making of their day-to-day activities. Machine learning (ML) techniques are applied to further enhance the intelligence and capabilities of an application. Many researchers are interested in producing advanced IoT technology, combining ML and IoT Techniques. Through ML, IIoT devices learn to perform tasks such as predication, pattern recognition, classification, and clustering. To provide for a learning process, IoT devices are trained using various algorithms in ML and statistical models to analyze sample data. The various fields of data sets (structured and unstructured data) are characterized by measuring functional parameters. Later, ML algorithms are applied to the data set to find features, provide useful output, identify patterns or make decisions based on the data set, draw inferences from real-time data streams, make their results available to analysts, and embed their results directly in business processes. In ML, the real-time problem is classified by classification, clustering, regression models, and association rules.

Evaluating Replenishment Systems for Disposable Supplies at the Operating Theater: A Simulation Case Study,"Ensuring cost containment while providing high quality patient care is of paramount concern to hospitals. The operating theater in particular is a major cost driver for any hospital, and is among the most critical resources in terms of both capacity and patient care. Effective inventory and distribution systems are a prerequisite for realizing efficiency improvements in the internal operating theater supply chain. In this work, discrete-event simulation is used to model part of the internal distribution process in the operating theater at a Belgian Hospital and to identify improvements by focusing on the replenishment process. A logistics performance measurement framework based on Analytic Network Process (ANP), as a popular Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique, is adopted to assess three replenishment scenarios. The best performing scenario is selected using the Internal Logistics Efficiency Performance (ILEP) index as an evaluation basis. This research indicates that industrial engineering techniques, such as simulation and MCDM, which are successfully applied in industrial sectors, can also be adopted to realize efficiency opportunities in healthcare logistics.",Springer Proceedings in Mathematics and Statistics,2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-39694-7_12
Performance indicator selection for operating room supply chains: An application of ANP,"Manufacturing and maintenance processes significantly benefit from effective and integrated Supply Chain Management (SCM). Recently, hospitals start to recognize the importance of these logistics initiatives to improve their operational performance while also maintaining high quality of patient care. Patient care processes are supported by a range of supply chain activities including inventory management and distribution of medical supplies to point-of-care locations. At the operating room for instance, the logistics staff's goal is managing materials and information flows to have the requested materials at the right operating room at the right time, in the most efficient way. However, poor inventory management, lack of standardization and lack of coordination between departments complicate healthcare logistics processes, and hence result in many waste. Opportunities for efficiency gains in these logistics processes can be identified by measuring the performance of the internal supply chain. This paper presents a rigorously defined logistics performance measurement framework to evaluate the efficiency of logistics processes in operating rooms. The Analytic Network Process (ANP) is utilized as a popular Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique to provide effective decision-support models. The proposed ANP-based framework is a first step towards measuring the performance of operating room supply chain processes by selecting and prioritizing logistics objectives and associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Further research is required to validate the ANP framework by including multiple stakeholders’ preferences, as they may have conflicting views on performance definitions. The final goal of the framework is to support hospital logistics managers in making transparent and informed decisions to improve inventory and distribution policies in the operating room while considering all stakeholders’ preferences.",Operations Research for Health Care,2019-12-01,10.1016/j.orhc.2019.100229
Sustainable supply chain management practices and sustainable performance in hospitals: A systematic review and integrative framework,"Hospital supply chains are responsible for several economic inefficiencies, negative environmental impacts, and social concerns. However, a lack of research on sustainable supply chain management specific to this sector is identified. Existing studies do not analyze supply chain management practices in an integrated and detailed manner, and do not consider all sustainable performance dimensions. To address these gaps, this paper presents a systematic literature review and develops a framework for identifying the supply chain management practices that may contribute to sustainable performance in hospitals. The proposed framework is composed of 12 categories of management practices, which include strategic management and leadership, supplier management, purchasing, warehousing and inventory, transportation and distribution, information and technology, energy, water, food, hospital design, waste, and customer relationship management. On the other side, performance categories include economic, environmental, and social factors. Moreover, illustrative effects of practices on performance are discussed. The novelty of this document lies in its focus on hospital settings, as well as on its comprehensiveness regarding the operationalization of practices and performance dimensions. In addition, a future research agenda is provided, which emphasizes the need for improved research generalizability, empirical validation, integrative addressing, and deeper analysis of relationships between practices and performance.",Sustainability (Switzerland),2019-11-01,10.3390/su11215949

Service modularity in managing healthcare logistics,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how modularity is used for enabling value creation in managing healthcare logistics services. Design/methodology/approach: Material logistics of four different kinds of hospitals is examined through a qualitative case study. The theoretical framework builds on the literature on healthcare logistics, service modularity and value creation. Findings: The case hospitals have developed their material logistics independently from others when looking at the modularity of offerings, processes and organisations. Services, such as assortment management, shelving and developing an information platform, have been performed in-house partly by the care personnel, but steps towards modularised and standardised solutions are now being taken in the case hospitals, including ideas about outsourcing some of the services. Research limitations/implications: This paper proposes seven modularity components for healthcare logistics management: segmentation, categorisation and unitisation of offerings, differentiation and decoupling of processes, and centralisation and specialisation of organisations. Thus, this study clarifies the three-dimensional concept of modularity as a cognitive frame for managing logistics services with heterogeneous customer needs in a rapidly changing healthcare environment. Practical implications: Modularity offers a tool for developing logistics services inside the hospital and increases possibilities to consider also external logistics service providers. Social implications: Managing healthcare logistics services through modularity has potential social implications in developing healthcare processes and changing the usage of health services. On a wider scale, modularity is helping healthcare systems reaching their goals in terms of service quality and cost. Originality/value: This paper shows the context-specific antecedents of service modularity and the usage of modular thinking in managing healthcare logistics.",International Journal of Logistics Management,2019-02-12,10.1108/IJLM-12-2017-0338

Develop the healthcare logistics service with kano model,"With the advancement of information and communication technologies in the healthcare industry and the strong growth in the sales of temperature sensitive healthcare products, the demand for cold chain logistics service has increased greatly in recent years. Therefore, developing an effective logistics service model for cold chain logistics is essential to help enterprises improve logistics quality and reduce cost. This study aims at applying the five dimensions of service quality (SERVQUAL) model to construct the service elements that customers are concerned about, and then applied the Kano model to categorize the service elements. For analyzing customers’ needs, primary data were collected from a survey administered to respondents who have used a logistics service for healthcare products. Through the convenient sampling, a total of 101 effective paper-based survey questionnaires were received for analysis. From the classification results, 2 service elements are classified as attractive elements, 8 service elements are classified as must-be elements, 15 services elements are classified as one-dimensional elements, 1 service elements is classified as an indifferent element, and no service elements are classified as reverse element in this study. Specifically, this study identified the service elements that need to be modified in the future pursuit of a more innovative service model, to develop a new cold chain logistics service for healthcare that better satisfies customers and creates and maintains a competitive advantage. Practitioners and researchers in the field of cold chain logistics may refer to this study’s findings of customers’ needs and classified service elements with the Kano model to assist in developing new logistics service model.",Journal of Quality,2019-01-01,10.6220/joq.201902_26(1).0001
Measuring the logistics performance of internal hospital supply chains – A literature study,"The patient care processes in hospitals are supported by a range of operational activities including inventory management and distribution of supplies to point-of-care locations. Hospitals carry large amounts and a great variety of items, and the issues of storing and distributing these items throughout the hospital supply chain are of great importance to providing high-quality patient service. Healthcare logistics encompasses the process of handling physical goods (e.g. pharmaceuticals, surgical medical products, medical equipment, sterile items, linen, food, etc.) and the associated information flows, from the reception of the goods within a hospital to their delivery at patient care locations. The medical supply costs constitute the second largest expenditure in hospitals, after personnel costs. A high-performing supply chain may realize improved outcomes (e.g. safe and quality patient service) and greater efficiency. Logistics managers need to identify opportunities to improve the logistics processes in order to lower costs and to improve patient care quality. However, in order to improve the logistics processes, you must understand how the healthcare supply chain is currently performing. Measuring the performance of the supply chain is fundamental to identify and address deficiencies in the logistics activities, and it serves as a good input for managerial decision-making. The purpose of this article is to present existing research on performance measurement at the internal hospital supply chain (e.g. inventory management, distribution activities), and more specifically in the operating theatre since it is among the most critical resources for a hospital. At the operating theatre, the requested items should be available at the right time at the right place, in the right condition, at the lowest cost possible. Furthermore, we will also discuss literature on multi-criteria decision-making techniques. It enables researchers to build a performance measurement framework and to prioritize between multiple performance indicators since a diverse group of stakeholders with conflicting interests is involved in the internal operating room supply chain.",Omega (United Kingdom),2019-01-01,10.1016/j.omega.2018.01.007
A systematic literature review of simulation models for non-technical skill training in healthcare logistics,"Background: Resource allocation in patient care relies heavily on individual judgements of healthcare professionals. Such professionals perform coordinating functions by managing the timing and execution of a multitude of care processes for multiple patients. Based on advances in simulation, new technologies that could be used for establishing realistic representations have been developed. These simulations can be used to facilitate understanding of various situations, coordination training and education in logistics, decision-making processes, and design aspects of the healthcare system. However, no study in the literature has synthesized the types of simulations models available for non-technical skills training and coordination of care. Methods: A systematic literature review, following the PRISMA guidelines, was performed to identify simulation models that could be used for training individuals in operative logistical coordination that occurs on a daily basis. This article reviewed papers of simulation in healthcare logistics presented in the Web of Science Core Collections, ACM digital library, and JSTOR databases. We conducted a screening process to gather relevant papers as the knowledge foundation of our literature study. The screening process involved a query-based identification of papers and an assessment of relevance and quality. Results: Two hundred ninety-four papers met the inclusion criteria. The review showed that different types of simulation models can be used for constructing scenarios for addressing different types of problems, primarily for training and education sessions. The papers identified were classified according to their utilized paradigm and focus areas. (1) Discrete-event simulation in single-category and single-unit scenarios formed the most dominant approach to developing healthcare simulations and dominated all other categories by a large margin. (2) As we approached a systems perspective (cross-departmental and cross-institutional), discrete-event simulation became less popular and is complemented by system dynamics or hybrid modeling. (3) Agent-based simulations and participatory simulations have increased in absolute terms, but the share of these modeling techniques among all simulations in this field remains low. Conclusions: An extensive study analyzing the literature on simulation in healthcare logistics indicates a growth in the number of examples demonstrating how simulation can be used in healthcare settings. Results show that the majority of studies create situations in which non-technical skills of managers, coordinators, and decision makers can be trained. However, more system-level and complex system-based approaches are limited and use methods other than discrete-event simulation.",Advances in Simulation,2018-12-01,10.1186/s41077-018-0072-7
Logistics outsourcing in the healthcare sector: Lessons from a Canadian experience,"Logistics activities are seen by many healthcare organizations as an opportunity for financial savings. The level of logistics complexity in these organizations may explain the challenges they face in applying solutions common in other industries. This case study of a medical-supply distribution outsourcing initiative to a logistics services provider by a group of hospitals in a region of Canada helps elucidate this complexity. The objective of this article is to identify the dissonances between various points of view in order to articulate lessons for managers while taking into account the specifics of the healthcare sector. By examining information from several sources, this study shows the necessity of: 1) setting objectives and managing expectations in order to maintain the interest and participation of stakeholders throughout the project; 2) updating internal logistics processes prior to outsourcing; 3) carefully considering a gradual transition phase by ensuring short-term benefits for both partners; 4) requiring problem-solving skills as a selection criterion for the logistics services provider to ensure continuous improvement in the performance of the outsourced activity; and 5) developing a governance accountability framework to support problem solving between all parties involved.

Logistics practices in healthcare organizations in Bogota,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the current state of logistics practices in healthcare organizations in Bogota, Colombia. Design/methodology/approach: The assessment is based on case study research using open interviews, focused interviews, a questionnaire and direct observations as sources of evidence. Seven Colombian health care settings are analyzed: four public hospitals and three private clinics. Cross-case analysis allows the identification of patterns regarding supply management, inventory management, replenishment and use of information and communication technologies. Findings: Manual procedures, poor planning, little recognition from top management and a lack of specialized personnel characterize the current situation. Innovative practices with a potential to improve the efficacy of logistics activities are rare, particularly in public hospitals. Research avenues: Future research could replicate this study in other Colombian cities, in order to generalize the results to the whole country. It could also be interesting to document successful and less successful implementations of innovative logistics practices in Colombian hospitals to guide and promote their adoption. Research limitations/implications: The small number of cases considered, and the fact that the research is concentrated in one city, limits the generalizability of the results. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is the first to explore the state of healthcare logistics practices in Colombia.",Academia Revista Latinoamericana de Administracion,2018-11-30,10.1108/ARLA-08-2016-0219
Overall user satisfaction with family planning services and associated quality care factors: A cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Studies of user satisfaction with family planning services (FPSs) have been conducted in different countries, and have been employed to identify ways of improving health, reducing costs and implementing reforms. The present work is the first-ever study undertaken in Mexico on the subject. Our objective was to identify how overall user satisfaction with FPSs in Mexico was related to: healthcare logistics, the functional value of services and the quality of interpersonal relations. Methods: Users of 18 public clinics were surveyed in 2015. Data collected referred to their past and present use of FPSs, as well as to their perceptions of the services provided. We built a logistic regression model with potentially influential variables in order to assess their association with overall satisfaction. Results: According to the self-reports of the 722 users interviewed, the following factors were decisive in their overall satisfaction with services: receiving sufficient information during visits (OR = 3.38; 95% CI:1.88-6.06), feeling that their opinions were taken into consideration by clinic staff (OR = 2.58; 95% CI:1.14-5.85), feeling that the motives for their visits were addressed (OR = 2.71; 95% CI:1.29-5.71), being assigned enough time for consultation (OR = 2.35; 95% CI:1.26-4.37), having the opportunity to ask questions and clarify doubts (OR = 2.31; 95% CI:1.21-4.43), experiencing no or few interruptions during their medical consultations (OR = 1.97;95% CI:1.10-3.51), and feeling satisfied with the contraceptive method provided (OR = 1.79; 95% CI:1.03-3.11). Conclusions: Service providers must be kept well informed on the perspective of users concerning user expectations. Taking into account the cultural context and perceived needs of users while providing service would improve the quality of care and, hence, the overall satisfaction of users.",Reproductive Health,2018-10-12,10.1186/s12978-018-0615-3
Hospital Capacity Planning for Special Economic Zone in Thailand: A Case Study in Kanchanaburi Province,"Increasing the employment demand in a particular region has an impact on the healthcare system due to types of occupational diseases/injuries and number of workers. Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand, is one of target areas to launch special economic zone (SEZ), which will cause dramatic population growth. Thus the aim of this research is to propose hospital capacity planning in Kanchanaburi taking into account the upcoming SEZ. This study employs a two-stage approach for data collection and validation. Firstly, interview and focus group is used to gather all related healthcare logistic issues. Then hospital's capacity is forecasted based on target health provider-topopulation ratios. The results show that current healthcare services in Kanchanaburi will not be sufficient to support the projected population.",IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management,2018-07-02,10.1109/IEEM.2018.8607755
Where to locate medical supplies in nursing units: An exploratory study,"Nursing unit inventory management is often cited as the top irritant that limits nurses’ ability to provide care at bedside. Our research focus is to determine whether the inventory location in the nursing units interferes with the performance of the replenishment system. The literature review suggests that a decentralization of nursing unit storage areas will require additional logistics resources to manage all of these storage points. Our case studies of four Canadian hospitals tend to demonstrate that decentralized locations do not necessarily lead to a decrease in productivity for logistics staff. Furthermore, although our research focuses on the inventory location in nursing units, it is difficult to isolate the impact of this aspect in the context of the entire replenishment system. For example, reorder frequency also has an impact on productivity. Further research could focus on these topics.",Supply Chain Forum,2018-01-01,10.1080/16258312.2018.1433438
Healthcare logistics in disaster planning and emergency management: A perspective,"This paper discusses the role of healthcare supply chain management in disaster mitigation and management. While there is an abundance of literature examining emergency management and disaster preparedness efforts across an array of industries, little information has been directed specifically toward the emergency interface, interoperability and unconventional relationships among civilian institutions and the US Department of Defense (US DoD) or supply chain operations involved therein. To address this imbalance, this paper provides US DoD healthcare supply chain managers with concepts related to communicating and planning more effectively. It is worth remembering, however, that all disasters are local - under the auspice of tiered response involving federal agencies, the principal responsibility for responding to domestic disasters and emergencies rests with the lowest level of government equipped and able to deal with the incident effectively. As such, the findings are equally applicable to institutions outside the military. It also bears repeating that every crisis is unique: there is no such thing as a uniform response for every incident. The role of the US DoD in emergency preparedness and disaster planning is changing and will continue to do so as the need for roles in support of a larger effort also continues to change.",Journal of business continuity &amp; emergency planning,2017-12-01,
Outsourcing strategies and distribution models in Italian Pharma Supply Chain,"In the pharmaceutical supply chain, all players have to ensure the highest level of service while containing costs, because of the ethical issues concerning drugs. The outsourcing of logistics should be recognized as a competitive lever, especially in this complex and highly regulated industry. Based on these premises, the research objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between the outsourcing strategies of manufacturers and the logistics services offered by Third-Party Logistics Service providers (3PLs). To achieve this objective, a multiple case study was designed to analyse the different physical distribution models adopted by pharmaceutical companies. We collected qualitative data and the subjective perceptions of several logistics directors, conducting structured interviews with 11 pharmaceutical companies and six 3PLs. We have identified three physical distribution models, on the basis of the number and location of the warehouses used (single warehouse, dual warehouse and multi-warehouse models). We discovered that there is a strict relationship between the physical distribution model adopted by pharmaceutical companies and their features (i.e. the main distribution channel, product portfolio, target service level, transport and warehousing costs and other company related issues). Our research also offers an empirical insight into the key logistic services that 3PLs should offer within the pharma industry. In conclusion, the study draws a roadmap to guide pharmaceutical companies in their strategic logistics decisions in Italy, while also considering possible future trends deriving from changes to European regulations.","Proceedings - 2017 IEEE International Conference on Service Operations and Logistics, and Informatics, SOLI 2017",2017-11-27,10.1109/SOLI.2017.8120990
A Roadmap Towards Healthcare Logistics in Thailand,"Apart from operation dimension in supply chain, another perspective in healthcare supply chain is the infrastructure for Logistics. This infrastructure concerns much in data and information flows. The study focuses on three levels for constructing this infrastructures: Public health policy maker, provincial public health office and hospital levels. A survey was conducted. The framework for data collections was based on data standardization, database and its applications. The findings identified the status of such areas. It shows that lack of standardization could lead to poor information in the supply chain. Five core components for the foundation are recommended. These are standard data, standard exchange data, a single data pool, ability to track and trace and data centre. Implications and suggestions for policy makers are recommended.","2017 International Conference on Industrial Engineering, Management Science and Application, ICIMSA 2017",2017-07-19,10.1109/ICIMSA.2017.7985578
Mathematical model and exact algorithm for the home care worker scheduling and routing problem with lunch break requirements,"Home health care or home care (HHC/HC) refers to the delivery of social, medical and paramedical services to clients in their own homes. Each day, care workers start from the HHC/HC centre, visit some clients and return to the centre. During the service delivery process, there is usually a lunch break for each worker. In this paper, we address a real-life home care worker scheduling and routing problem with the consideration of lunch break requirements. A three-index mathematical model is constructed for the problem. The problem is decomposed into a master problem and several pricing sub-problems, and is optimally solved by a branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm. Specifically, a sophisticated label-correcting algorithm is designed to address lunch break constraints in pricing sub-problems; some cutting-edge acceleration strategies are applied during the column generation process. Experimental results show that the proposed B&P algorithm is able to produce satisfied solutions within an acceptable runtime and outperforms the mixed integer programming solver CPLEX.",International Journal of Production Research,2017-01-17,10.1080/00207543.2016.1213917
A structured review of quantitative models of the pharmaceutical supply chain,"The aim of this review is to identify and provide a structured overview of quantitative models in the pharmaceutical supply chain, a subject not exhaustively studied in the previous reviews on healthcare logistics related mostly to quantitative models in healthcare or logistics studies in hospitals. The models are classified into three categories of classification: network design, inventory models, and optimization of a pharmaceutical supply chain. A taxonomy for each category is shown describing the principal features of each echelon included in the review; this taxonomy allows the readers to identify easily a paper based on the actors of the pharmaceutical supply chain. The search process included research articles published in the databases between 1984 and November 2016. In total 46 studies were included. In the review process we found that in the three fields the most common source of uncertainty used is the demand in the 56% of the cases. Within the review process we can conclude that most of the articles in the literature are focused on the optimization of the pharmaceutical supply chain and inventory models but the field on supply chain network design is not deeply studied.",Complexity,2017-01-01,10.1155/2017/5297406

Strategy deployment in healthcare services: A case study approach,"For a number of years, multiple studies have suggested that the effective management of logistics can generate significant gains for healthcare institutions. Yet, the studies also show that despite widespread knowledge of best practices, most institutions struggle to deploy practices that can enhance the logistics performance of their organization. In fact, healthcare institution managers are lacking guidelines enabling them to deploy a logistics strategy supporting the implementation of such practices. Using longitudinal case studies of two Canadian hospitals that made significant improvements in this regard, we will analyze the deployment strategy for exemplary materials management practices. In these studies, we will consider that two aspects are essential in deploying a logistics strategy in a service undertaking. First, there must be well-defined strategic intent. Based on this, the organization must implement an experimental series of logistics practices. This implementation process offers two benefits: 1) it should enable innovative practices to be tested, and 2) it should provide the organization with the time to absorb these innovations, particularly given the complex environment within a hospital.",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2016-12-01,10.1016/j.techfore.2016.09.006
Energy efficient approach to send data in cognitive radio wireless sensor networks(CRSN),"The adoption of cognitive radio wireless sensor networks be supposed to preserve developing, essentially in such a fields as a healthcare, logistic, scientific and a military applications. Yet, a sensor size or dimension represents a consequential constraint mainly in expressions of an energy autonomy and as a result of a life period for the batteries which is so too tiny. Thus, the reason why a concentrated research being conducted at the present time on how to control energy consumption in sensor within a network, taking communications into account as a precedence. For this intention, we propose a algorithm or method to send data from source to sink with a less energy consumption within cognitive wireless sensor networks, according to the number of nodes, data flow rate, and the distance between them. Moreover, we have succeeded in sinking energy utilization within a linear sensor network through up with nodes featuring with differing data flow rates between them.","2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics, ICACCI 2016",2016-11-02,10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732352

A way for reducing drug supply chain cost for a hospital district: A case study,"Purpose: This work aims at providing insights to optimise healthcare logistic of the drug management, in order to deal with the healthcare expenditure cut. In this paper the effects of different drug supply chain configurations, on the resulting average stock, service level and Bullwhip effect, of the studied supply chain, is quantitatively assessed. Design/methodology/approach: A case study of an Italian district has been studied, taking into account three echelons: suppliers, central stock, and hospitals. A model of the various supply chain configurations has been created with the use of the simulation. Specifically, 24 supply chain configurations have been examined, stemming from the combination of several supply chain design parameters, namely: transshipment policies (Emergency Lateral Transshipment or Total Inventory Equalization); re-order and inventory management policies (Economic Order Quantity or Economic Order Interval); required service levels (90% or 95%); the number of available vans (one or two). For each configuration, hospital average stock, service level and a “Bullwhip effect” analysis are computed. To know which input variables are statistically significant, a DoE (Design of Experiments) analysis has been executed. Findings: The output of this paper provides useful insights and suggestions to optimize the healthcare logistic and drug supply chain. According to the developed DoE analysis, it can be stated that the introduction of transshipment policies provides important improvement in terms of service and stock levels. To reduce the Bullwhip effect, which results in a service level decreasing, and in a managing stock costs increasing, it is worth to adopt an EOQ re-order policy. Practical implications: This research gives practical recommendations to the studied system, in order to reduce costs and maintain a very satisfactory service level. Originality/value: This paper fulfils an identified need to study which combination of transshipment policies, re-order/inventory management policies and required service levels, can be the best one to reduce costs and maintain a very satisfactory service level, in the specific logistic system.",Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management,2016-01-01,10.3926/jiem.1262

Selective vehicle routing for a mobile blood donation system,"In this study, a mobile blood collection system is designed with the primary objective of increasing blood collection levels. This design also takes into account operational costs to aim for collection of large amounts of blood at reasonable cost. Bloodmobiles perform direct tours to certain activities to collect blood, but at the end of each day, they bring the collected blood to a designated depot to prevent its spoilage. The proposed system consists of the bloodmobiles and a new vehicle called the shuttle that visits the bloodmobiles in the field on each day and transfers the collected blood to the depot. Consequently, bloodmobiles can continue their tours without having to make daily returns to the depot. We propose a mathematical model and a 2-stage IP based heuristic algorithm to determine the tours of the bloodmobiles and the shuttle, and their lengths of stay at each stop. This new problem is defined as an extension of the Selective Vehicle Routing Problem and is referred to as the SVRP with Integrated Tours. The performances of the solution methodologies are tested first on a real data set obtained from past blood donation activities of Turkish Red Crescent in Ankara, and then on a constructed data set based on GIS data of the European part of Istanbul. The Pareto set of optimum solutions is generated based on blood amounts and logistics costs, and finally a sensitivity analysis on some important design parameters is conducted.",European Journal of Operational Research,2015-08-16,10.1016/j.ejor.2015.03.007

Measuring process performance within healthcare logistics - a decision tool for selecting track and trace technologies,"Monitoring tasks and ascertaining quality of work is difficult in a logistical healthcare process due to cleaning personnel being dispersed throughout the hospital. Performance measurement can support the organization in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of processes and in ensuring quality of work. Data validity is essential for enabling performance measurement, and selecting the right technologies is important to achieve this. A case study of the hospital cleaning process was conducted at a public Danish hospital to develop a framework for assessing technologies in healthcare logistics. A set of decision indicators was identified in the case study to assess technologies based on expected process performance.

Critical-to-life classification for managing inventory in a healthcare supply chain,"This paper presents a multi-criterion critical-to-life classification technique to supplement the cost and usage measures that are normally employed in hospital inventory management. A system dynamics model was developed employing (R, s, S) inventory control approach for a US private sector healthcare supply chain. Extensive simulation analyses were conducted to study the stock behaviour for low, medium and high usage critical-to-life items to maintain a range of service levels. The (R, s, S) design parameters were optimised according to the variability of item usage, the associated inventory level and supply lead-time. Our findings suggest that the proposed inventory classification technique allows for assigning a particular service level to each critical-to-life item to ensure its availability while minimising the cost and stock-out situations. The proposed simulation tool incorporating critical-to-life inventory classification facilitates hospital logistics managers to devise efficient inventory control strategies based on critical-to-life service level index.",International Journal of Intelligent Enterprise,2015-01-01,10.1504/IJIE.2015.073491
A hierarchical decomposition framework for modeling combinatorial optimization problems,"Complex Optimization Problems has existed in many fields of science, including economics, healthcare, logistics and finance where a complex problem has to be solved. Thus, modeling a complex problem is a fundamental step to relax its complexity and achieve to a final solution of the master problem. Hierarchical optimization is a main step in optimization problems handling process. It consists of decomposing an optimization problem into two or more sub-problems; each sub-problem has its own objectives and constraints. It will help to prove the correct understanding and represent the problem in a different form that facilitates its solving. In this work, we stipulate that a hierarchical decomposition of complex problems can yield to more effective solutions. The proposed framework will contain four possible strategies which will be detailed through this paper; objective based decomposition; constraints based decomposition, semantic decomposition and data partitioning strategy. Each strategy will be argued by a set of examples from the literature to validate our framework. However, some conditions shall be verified to model the problem using such conditions are problems' characteristics that will help to identify if a combinatorial optimization problem can be modeled within the proposed framework and they are detailed in the following subsections.",Procedia Computer Science,2015-01-01,10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.169
Towards an it-based coordination platform for the german emergency medical service system,"The German healthcare service system is facing a number of challenges in the years to come, prominent among these a decreasing number of hospitals and practices dealing with an increasing number of treatments and patient transportation tasks. In this paper, we introduce the idea of building a decision support tool to improve scheduling of patient transportation in the German Emergency Medical Service (EMS) system to reduce waiting times and costs, as well as increasing reliability. We outline a service platform on which the decision support tool could be realized and integrated with existing systems in EMS coordination centers. The paper thus introduces a promising approach for one of the main challenges of the German EMS system and builds the basis for further research on transport scheduling and healthcare services.",Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2015-01-01,10.1007/978-3-319-14980-6_20
Optimization of tag anti-collision algorithm for EPC Gen2 RFID,"The proliferation of the RFID (Radio-Frequency IDentification) technology in the last decade shows its importance as effective solution for a large variety of application scenarios, such as monitoring, homeland security, healthcare, logistic and last but not the least Internet of Things. Actually, an accurate RFID modeling, optimization and performance analysis via simulation is strongly desired. In this paper, the authors propose two innovations of tag anti-collision algorithm in EPC Gen 2 RFID Specification: i. the adaptive management of Q-parameter (to maximize the efficiency of the inventory procedure depending on the tags number) and its communication by a QueryAdjust command, and ii. the muting option, which silences the tags after their identification with the effect of reducing the offered load to the reader after each successful identification.","2014 Euro Med Telco Conference - From Network Infrastructures to Network Fabric: Revolution at the Edges, EMTC 2014",2014-12-23,10.1109/EMTC.2014.6996631
Design principles for robot inclusive spaces: A case study with Roomba,"Research focus on service robots That deals with applications related To healthcare, logistics, residential, search and rescue are gaining significant momentum in The recent years. Their social and economic relevance is more Than evident. Yet, while much has been researched about 'designing robots' focusing on sensing, actuation, mobility and control of service robots, little work has been done on 'design for robots' That looks at designing preferred artefacts or environments for such robots. In This work, we propose a new philosophy of robot inclusive spaces, a cross disciplinary approach That brings Together roboticians, architects and designers To solve numerous unsettled research problems in robotics community Through design of inclusive interior spaces for robots where The latter live and operate.

Tailoring LTE-advanced for M2M communication using wireless inband relay node,"Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication is one of the newest research fields today and is expected to play a vital role in business areas such as e-healthcare, logistics etc. Mobile communication standards, such as Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) are designed to provide high data rate and broadband services to human-based communication. However, the nature of M2M traffic is different as terminals usually have to transmit small amounts of data infrequently. In this paper, we evaluate an LTE-A Relay Node (RN) based solution to integrate M2M devices into mobile cellular networks. We develop an M2M scenario consisting of both e-healthcare and logistic devices along with normal LTE-A users in our simulation model using OPNET modeler. The simulation results indicate the better performance of LTE-A network if RN is used for the multiplexing and aggregation of M2M data traffic.","Proceedings of World Telecommunications Congress 2014, WTC 2014",2014-01-01,
Automation in internal logistics: Strategic and operational challenges,"Automation in internal logistics is an enabler to increase overall competitiveness in an organisation. However, its use is currently limited. The main objective of this paper is to highlight the existing strategic and operational challenges to using and developing automation in internal logistics. A three-phased empirical study has been conducted, including case studies and a survey. The findings reveal a lack of responsibility for, and insight in current state of logistics operations as well as a lack of vision and strategy giving directions for desired future state of operations. In addition, the actual automation projects are hindered by poorly defined and supported processes. It is concluded that functional strategies for internal logistics and automation can give the support needed along with process models for automation projects. The content and application of these strategies and models are suggested.

Drug inventory management and distribution: outsourcing logistics to thirdparty providers,"The purpose of the present research is to explore the current situation and future expectations on whether to selfmanage or outsource logistics operations in centralized healthcare networks, and to analyse and quantify the relationships between logistics outsourcing, costs and performance. The paper is based on a thorough study of a local Italian healthcare network, which evaluated the economic sustainability of logistics outsourcing. The data were collected using interviews, documentation and observations in hospital pharmacies and wards, and by referring to public information available on the internet. A system dynamic simulation followed by a sensitivity analysis was used to investigate the impact of changing key variables as well as the advice of logistics providers. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that logistics outsourcing is often the most economical choice. Performanceoriented concepts applied to healthcare have many pros in terms of sustainable delivery of quality healthcare at affordable costs. While there are numerous studies on logistics outsourcing in many industries, when it comes to the healthcare sector literature is scarce, probably due to the great changes this sector has faced in recent times: thus, the paper's quantitative findings should be seen as a first attempt to assist the “makeorbuy” decision process toward sustainable development of the healthcare sector. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Strategic Outsourcing: An International Journal,2013-02-15,10.1108/17538291311316063

Healthcare service modeling to minimize disruptions due to natural disasters,"The aftermath of any disaster could be enormous and annihilating especially for healthcare industry. In case of an emergency, the healthcare organizations in the affected region may experience out of stock situation for medical supplies which eventually impact their services. Healthcare providers need to replenish their supplies from central distribution centers or unaffected regional distribution centers. The most difficult situation that authorities face is the complexity of operating conditions where they had to work in order to supply medical items to the affected region from a central position. Some regions may be very difficult to reach under disaster condition. In this scenario it may be required to share medical items from contiguous health care organizations. Operations Research techniques have already been proven to be beneficial for different planning situations, mainly during the preparation and the response phase of disaster life cycle. There are very few works that have been done in the field of inventory relocation in case of a disaster. This paper discusses the modeling techniques to minimize the stock out situation of medical supplies in the natural disaster affected zones.",IIE Annual Conference and Expo 2013,2013-01-01,
Optimized Workflow for the Healthcare Logistic: Case of the Pediatric Emergency Department,"The Emergency Department (ED) in a hospital, as its name implies, is a facility to be utilized by those who require emergency medical care. This paper introduces the longitudinal organization of the patient handling"" in the Pediatric Emergency called the ""Pediatric Emergency Path"". This work discusses the usability of the workflow approach in order to design the patient path in the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) in order to thwart the care complexity scheme. The goal is to optimize these paths to improve the quality of the patient handling while mastering the wait time. The development of this model was based on accurate visits made in the PED of the Regional University Hospital Center (CHRU) of Lille (France). This modeling, which has to represent most faithfully possible the reality of the PED of CHRU of Lille, is necessary. It must be enough retailed to produce an analysis allowing to identify the dysfunctions of the PED and also to propose and to estimate prevention indicators of tensions.

Progress towards data standards adoption in healthcare,"The contribution of this paper is to report on the progress of and barriers to adoption of data standards in healthcare logistics. This paper is directed to engineering managers with an interest in healthcare management, information management, and supply chain management. Data standards in healthcare logistics fall into two categories: product identification numbers and location identification numbers. Product identification numbers are assigned to any item that may be priced, ordered, or invoiced at any point in any supply chain, location identification numbers are used to identify physical locations to improve the efficiency of communication with the supply chain. The main objective of this paper is to convey the potential benefits of data standards adoption in the healthcare supply chain and present empirical evidence of progress toward adoption as well as a discussion of barriers toward adoption. Data is presented and analyzed from surveys conducted in 2008, 2010 and 2011. The results show encouraging progress being made towards data standards adoption; however, many barriers still exist. Engineering managers will appreciate the potential benefits of data standards adoption in healthcare logistics and will see the role engineers and engineering managers can have in facilitating data standards adoption and overcoming the barriers faced. Engineering managers will also see the opportunities for healthcare process improvement once data standards are adopted.

Mapping the supply chain of anti-malarial drugs in Sub-Saharan African countries,"With malaria emerging as one of the deadliest infectious diseases for young children and women in Sub-Saharan African countries, a growing number of healthcare organisations and government authorities have increased their relentless efforts to control malaria epidemics in Africa. One of the causes for malaria epidemics is the lack of accessibility to anti-malarial drugs that results from archaic logistics infrastructure, inefficient distribution channels and disruptive black markets in Africa. This paper identifies factors that either enhance or hinder the accessibility of anti-malarial drugs to African population sectors vulnerable to malaria epidemics. In addition, it develops a comprehensive supply chain map that reveals the labyrinths of the African logistics infrastructure, distribution channels, government regulations and business customs. Based on this supply chain map, this paper proposes various supply chain strategies that improve the access of anti-malarial drugs and reduce the possibility of drug supply chain disruptions. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",International Journal of Logistics Systems and Management,2012-02-27,10.1504/IJLSM.2012.044047
Smart objects in healthcare: Impact on clinical logistics,"Hospitals are confronted today with a plethora of approaches for asset management with RFID and WLAN, cooling chain monitoring using sensor networks and RFID, and patient tracking using virtually any existing technology. The downside is that most approaches are not necessarily compatible let alone coordinated. Further, none of the technologies is really integrated into legacy systems or corresponding organizational structures and processes, thus the full power of innovative applications is not utilized. Introducing the concept of smart objects inspired by the Internet of Things can improve the situation by separating the capabilities and functions of an object from the implementing technology such as RFID or WLAN. Wireless tags become interchangeable, and business applications can be built independent from the underlying communication network. Supported by synchronized technological and business developments smart objects have the power to transform a hospital from an agglomeration of technologies into a smart environment.",Critical Issues for the Development of Sustainable E-health Solutions,2012-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4614-1536-7_19
From patients' needs to hospital pharmacy management: An holistic approach to the process modelling,"Materials management is a great issue for healthcare systems because it influences performances of structures in terms of clinical and financial outcomes.

This paper presents an integrated and detailed description and model of the hospital materials management process, able to tackle information from patient requirements to materials usage, according to traceability and streamlined processes perspectives. The holistic approach adopted, based on hospital cases analysis, literature review and international guidelines, tends to look at all actors, materials and processes involved, with the attempt to provide academicals and practitioners with a useful guide to the various technology-related, management and business issues that can arise during the design or reengineering of this business process and the associated information system.","1st International Workshop on Innovative Simulation for Health Care, IWISH 2012, Held at the International Multidisciplinary Modeling and Simulation Multiconference, I3M 2012",2012-01-01,
Patient journey modeling using integrated data structures in healthcare service operations,"Improving patient flow and patient satisfaction have attracted considerable interest in recent years. Recognizing the need for taking a holistic approach to improving healthcare service operations, this paper presents an integrated framework for patient journey modeling from admission through to discharge. The proposed framework enhances the capability of service delivery systems to cope with the uncertainty associated with planning and scheduling of healthcare service operations towards achieving the desired patient flow and satisfaction levels. The patient journey model developed based on the unitary structuring technique is illustrated using a selected healthcare scenario, identifying the patient flow with process and data elements, as well as information flows. It is shown that integration of processes, data elements, information flows and relationships enables modeling of patient journey for improving patient flow and satisfaction through effective and efficient planning of healthcare logistics. This patient journey model can be implemented in an enterprise resource planning system environment, as a software tool, for monitoring patient flow in real-time. © 2011 IEEE.","2011 IEEE Colloquium on Humanities, Science and Engineering, CHUSER 2011",2011-12-01,10.1109/CHUSER.2011.6163802
Cognizant healthcare logistics management: Ensuring resilience during crisis,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to convey a message of preparedness and mitigation to key stakeholders throughout the healthcare community concerning healthcare supply chain readiness and preparedness. Design/methodology/approach: Using a review of existent literature, this work examines and expounds upon the impact of effective supply chain management processes in disaster mitigation and planning. Findings: This paper presents a discourse in supply chain managers' involvement in disaster planning, identifying courses of action, and collaboratively planning for crisis. Logistics is a specific genre of skill sets within healthcare operations. Practical implications: Key tenets of logistics readiness and preparedness are often missed when developing strategies for disaster mitigation. While this discussion is directed specifically toward healthcare management, the principles are applicable across a wide array of industries. Social implications: Disaster affects everyone and is likely to occur in any type of organization. Leaders have an inherent responsibility to plan for both expected and unexpected events; the latter can present complexities that require intuitive reaction provided scenarios have been considered in advance. Arguably, the critical path to success involves effective process management and collaborative communications across multiple echelons of managerial responsibilities.

Data standards in healthcare supply chain operations,"This paper presents the challenges and benefits associated with adoption of healthcare supply chain data standards in a hospital environment. In a highly fragmented industry like healthcare with several stakeholders, the adoption and use of common data standards for identifying delivery locations and products is critical. Common data standards ensure system wide interoperability and visibility across the supply chain, contributing to improvements in patient safety and streamlined internal and external supply chain operations. However, the global healthcare industry has been significantly slow in adopting data standards in comparison to other industries like retail, manufacturing. We discuss the results from data standard adoption pilot project conducted by Center for Innovation in Healthcare Logistics (CIHL), University of Arkansas at Washington Regional Medical Center, a 325 bed not-for-profit hospital in Fayet-teville, Arkansas. CIHL data standards pilot involved studying the existing supply chain processes, design, pilot-test, and evaluation of GS1 data standards adoption over a sample of products and a single delivery location at the hospital. We present the results, which demonstrate the capabilities of systemwide improvements and roadblocks likely to be encountered.

Managing processes on mobile devices: The marple approach,"Ubiquitous Computing is considered as enabler for linking everyday life with information and communication technology. However, developing pervasive applications that provide personalized user assistance is still a challenge. Relevant scenarios are diverse and encompass domains like healthcare, logistics, and business collaboration. Two of the technologies that show increasing maturity in respect to the demands of such applications are light-weight frameworks and process engines for mobile computing. Their fusion, however, is in a rather premature state. Generally, the support of mobile collaboration using a process engine raises challenging issues that need to be addressed. In the MARPLE project we target at a tight integration of process management technology with mobile computing frameworks in order to enable mobile process support in the aforementioned scenarios. In this demo paper we give insights into the MARPLE architecture and its components.

Red cell storage,"Blood component storage allows the donor and recipient to be separated in time and space. This separation converts transfusion from a desperate clinical act into a planned, orderly healthcare logistic activity with concomitant increases in both blood product availability and safety. However, storage has the potential to reduce the efficacy of transfused blood components by reducing their flow, functional capacity, and survival. Storage time also allows the accumulation of leaked potassium from red cells and the growth of contaminating bacteria. Many different aspects of the red cell storage lesion have been described, including changes in metabolism, shape, and rheology changes, loss of membrane carbohydrates, lipids and proteins, and alterations in secretion, oxygen delivery, and adhesion. What has been harder to show is that these known changes have significant clinical effects. Therefore, regulatory decisions about product storage have been conservative, and largely based on historic patterns of use. The increasing power of proteomics and metabolomics offers the potential of deeper understanding of blood function and storage and of better clinical products in the future. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Healthcare logistics: A comparative study in 12 hospitals,"Hospitals are characterized by, its complexity, the simultaneous presence of two distribution chains: the external and the internal. The external supply chain includes the multitude of different supplies and the distribution channels through which they flow. For the internal supply chain to the patient care units, hospitals must deploy their own distribution network. According to several studies, it is estimated that 46% of a hospital's total operating budget is spent on logistics related activities. Nursing staff will spend on average 10% of their time on logistic tasks. Due to the diversity of the healthcare materials management in hospitals, distributors were offering, instead of the conventional replenishment method, a stockless replenishment method, whereby the distributor picks and packs products, according to the needs of each patient care unit, and delivers them directly. The practices identified for the internal supply chain management systems are 1) on view, 2) par level systems or 3) the implementation of double container replenishment systems also called two bin or empty-full.
