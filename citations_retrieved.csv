Enhancing healthcare supply chain management through artificial intelligence-driven group decision-making with Sugeno–Weber triangular norms in a dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy context,"The healthcare industry faces numerous challenges in managing its supply chain efficiently, where critical decisions must be made promptly to ensure the availability of essential medical resources. This research introduces a novel artificial intelligence (AI) approach, utilizing the “Sugeno–Weber (SW) t-conorms and t-norms” (SWt-CNs&t-Ns) for decision-making in a Dual Hesitant q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy (DHq-ROF) context. The SWt-CNs&t-Ns are chosen for their adaptability in data unification, serving as prominent operations for union and intersection processes. Developing a set of fundamental operations is imperative to effectively utilize SWt-CNs&t-Ns and hybrid aggregation operators in DHq-ROF settings. Following the introduction of these processes, several aggregating operators have been provided. These operators include DHq-ROF SW weighted averaging, ordered weighted averaging, hybrid averaging, and their geometric counterparts utilizing DHq-ROF data. The SW triangular norm-based approach aggregates group preferences, facilitating a systematic decision-making process. Triangular norms ensure a realistic representation of interrelationships among decision criteria, leading to optimal healthcare supply chain management solutions. Furthermore, the SW triangular norm-based approach aggregates group preferences, enabling a systematic and comprehensive decision-making process. Choosing the best healthcare supply chain management solutions is easier when you use triangular norms because they give a more accurate picture of how the decision criteria affect each other. The effectiveness of the proposed AI framework is demonstrated through a series of experiments and case studies, showcasing its ability to enhance decision accuracy, reduce uncertainty, and improve overall supply chain performance. The research findings underscore the potential of AI-driven solutions to revolutionize healthcare supply chain management, ultimately leading to better resource allocation, cost efficiency, and improved patient care.",Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2024-09-01,10.1016/j.engappai.2024.108794
Investigating the Impact of Drone Transport on the Stability of Monoclonal Antibodies for Inter-Hospital Transportation,"In the field of healthcare logistics, the reliance on conventional transport methods such as cars for the delivery of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is susceptible to challenges posed by traffic and infrastructure, leading to increased and unpredictable transport times. Recognizing the potential role of drones in mitigating these challenges, we aimed to investigate the impact of medical drone transport on the stability of mAbs. Compromised stability could lead to aggregation and immunogenicity, thereby jeopardizing the efficacy and safety of mAbs. We studied the transportation of vials as well as ready-to-administer infusion bags with blinatumomab, tocilizumab, and daratumumab. The methodology involved the measurement of both temperature and mechanical shock during drone transport. Moreover, the analytical techniques High Performance Size-Exclusion Chromatography (HP-SEC), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Light Obscuration (LO), Micro-Flow Imaging (MFI), and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) were employed to comprehensively assess the presence of aggregates and particle formation. The key findings revealed no significant differences between car and drone transport, indicating that the stability of mAbs in both vials and infusion bags was adequately maintained during drone transport. This suggests that medical drones are a viable and reliable means for the inter-hospital transport of mAbs, paving the way for more efficient and predictable logistics in healthcare delivery.",Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences,2024-07-01,10.1016/j.xphs.2024.04.002
Iterative matheuristic for the biomedical sample transportation problem,"This paper proposes an iterative matheuristic for solving the biomedical sample transportation problem (BSTP), which is a routing problem with multiple and interdependent visits in the context of healthcare services. In this problem, the biomedical samples are collected from individuals at a set of healthcare or specimen collection centers and must be transported to designated laboratories to be analyzed. The perishable nature of the specimens forces to visit the collection centers more than once a day to ensure that the time from the moment they are drawn to the arrival at the laboratory do not exceed the samples lifespan. Also, a visit to one center imposes (1) a limit on the duration of the route that transports its samples to the laboratory, and (2) a limit on the latest time at which the same center must be visited again, creating an interdependency between visits, routes and the decision concerning the centers’ opening times. This paper first proposes a mathematical formulation to model the BSTP. Since this formulation is not able to solve medium or large sized instances efficiently, it also proposes an iterative matheuristic, which includes two main steps. The first step produces an approximated solution to the BSTP by a decomposition approach that splits the problem into a series of smaller subproblems that are solved by the proposed mathematical formulation. In the second step, two fix-&-optimize strategies are used with the mathematical formulation to perform a local search around the solutions produced by the decomposition method. The matheuristic has demonstrated its efficiency solving a rich set of real-life instances corresponding to the needs of several regions in the province of Quebec, Canada, in a fraction of the time required to solve the exact mathematical formulation.",Computers and Industrial Engineering,2024-06-01,10.1016/j.cie.2024.110196

Real-time management of intra-hospital patient transport requests,"This paper addresses the management of patients’ transportation requests within a hospital, a very challenging problem where requests must be scheduled among the available porters so that patients arrive at their destination timely and the resources invested in patient transport are kept as low as possible. Transportation requests arrive during the day in an unpredictable manner, so they need to be scheduled in real-time. To ensure that the requests are scheduled in the best possible manner, one should also reconsider the decisions made on pending requests that have not yet been completed, a process that will be referred to as rescheduling. This paper proposes several policies to trigger and execute the rescheduling of pending requests and three approaches (a mathematical formulation, a constructive heuristic, and a local search heuristic) to solve each rescheduling problem. A simulation tool is proposed to assess the performance of the rescheduling strategies and the proposed scheduling methods to tackle instances inspired by a real mid-size hospital. Compared to a heuristic that mimics the way requests are currently handled in our partner hospital, the best combination of scheduling method and rescheduling strategy produces an average 5.7 minutes reduction in response time and a 13% reduction in the percentage of late requests. Furthermore, since the total distance walked by porters is substantially reduced, our experiments demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the number of porters – and therefore the operating costs – without reducing the current level of service.",Health Care Management Science,2024-06-01,10.1007/s10729-024-09667-6

Home healthcare in Spanish rural areas: Applying vehicle routing algorithms to health transport management,"Depopulation of rural areas poses a range of new challenges for the provision of public services. Access to primary care centres is essential for promoting and protecting quality of life, especially for the older population. However, many rural municipalities face abandonment from public administrations by not even having a local clinic and forcing their dwellers to drive to the nearest facility. This research examines the adequacy of providing home healthcare (HHC) systems in such areas to avoid unnecessary trips. When designing routes to provide these services, decision-makers must take into account the following: (i) wide geographical spread of places to visit; (ii) difficulty in accessing some of these places with heavy medically equipped vehicles; and (iii) uncertainty regarding places to visit and availability of professionals. Our study identifies municipalities in which the travelling distance to the closest centre is above a desirable threshold, estimating the magnitude of the problem. Then, we provide an illustrative example in which an agile methodology is presented to design efficient routes that allow policymakers to offer HHC services of reasonable quality.",Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,2024-04-01,10.1016/j.seps.2024.101828

An Automated Enhancement System of Diabetic Retinopathy Fundus Image for Eye Care Facilities,"Examining retinal fundus images is compulsory for ophthalmologists to spot features of eye diseases. Some problems, including low contrast and blurred retinal fundus image, may seriously affect the diagnostic procedure, leading to misdiagnosis. Low quality of retinal fundus image makes recognition of features for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) to be harder for the ophthalmologist. Moreover, there is a lack of eye care facilities infrastructure with ophthalmologists to serve multi-morbid DR patients in rural areas, specifically Malaysia. Hence, this research proposed the development of an automated enhancement system based on computer vision and the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field to improve the quality of fundus images captured. The DR Enhancement System (DRES) helps ophthalmologists in the screening aspect by improving the detection of aberrant fundus images. Several methods for improving the fundus image are utilized: Retinex, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and Low-light enhancement. Results show that all methods performed better when improving low-contrast and blurred images.

An efficient adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm based on heuristics and reformulations for the generalized quadratic assignment problem,"Operations Research (OR) analytics play a crucial role in optimizing decision-making processes for real-world problems. The assignment problem, with applications in supply chains, healthcare logistics, and production scheduling, represents a prominent optimization challenge. This paper focuses on addressing the Generalized Quadratic Assignment Problem (GQAP), a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. To tackle the GQAP, we propose an OR analytical approach that incorporates efficient relaxations, reformulations, heuristics, and a metaheuristic algorithm. Initially, we employ the Reformulation Linearization Technique (RLT) to generate various linear relaxation models, carefully selecting the most efficient ones. Building upon this foundation, we introduce a robust reformulation based on Benders Decomposition (BD), which serves as the basis for an iterative optimization algorithm applied to the GQAP. Furthermore, we develop a constructive heuristic algorithm to identify near-optimal solutions, followed by an enhancement utilizing an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) metaheuristic algorithm. This ALNS algorithm is enhanced through the integration of a tabu list derived from Tabu Search (TS) and a decision rule inspired by Simulated Annealing (SA).

The COVID-19 pandemic and follow-up for shoulder surgery: The impact of a shift toward telemedicine on validated patient-reported outcomes,"Introduction: The emergence of COVID-19 and its ensuing restrictions on in-person healthcare has resulted in a sudden shift towards the utilization of telemedicine. The purpose of this study is to assess patient satisfaction and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for individuals who underwent follow-up for shoulder surgery using telemedicine compared to those who received traditional in-person clinic follow-up. Methods: Patients who underwent either rotator cuff repair or total shoulder arthroplasty during a designated pre-COVID-19 (traditional clinic follow-up) or peri-COVID-19 (telemedicine follow-up) span of time were identified. PROMs including the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons standardized assessment form, the three-level version of the EQ-5D form, the 12-Item Short Form survey, and a modified version of a published telemedicine survey were administered to participants six months post-operatively via phone call. Results: Sixty patients agreed to participate. There was no significant difference between the pre-COVID-19 and peri-COVID-19 groups in patient satisfaction with their follow-up visit (p = 0.289), nor was there a significant difference in PROMs between the two groups. In total, 83.33% of the telemedicine group and 70.37% of the in-person clinic group preferred traditional in-person follow-up over telemedicine. Discussion: In a cohort of patients who underwent telemedicine follow-up for shoulder surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no difference in patient satisfaction and PROMs compared to traditional in-person clinic follow-up. This study indicates that while the majority of participants preferred face-to-face visits, patients were relatively satisfied with their care and had similar functional outcome scores in both groups, despite the large disruption in healthcare logistics caused by COVID-19.",Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare,2023-07-01,10.1177/1357633X21990997
Divide and Conquer: A Location-Allocation Approach to Sectorization,"Sectorization is concerned with dividing a large territory into smaller areas, also known as sectors. This process usually simplifies a complex problem, leading to easier solution approaches to solving the resulting subproblems. Sectors are built with several criteria in mind, such as equilibrium, compactness, contiguity, and desirability, which vary with the applications. Sectorization appears in different contexts: sales territory design, political districting, healthcare logistics, and vehicle routing problems (agrifood distribution, winter road maintenance, parcel delivery). Environmental problems can also be tackled with a sectorization approach; for example, in municipal waste collection, water distribution networks, and even in finding more sustainable transportation routes. This work focuses on sectorization concerning the location of the area’s centers and allocating basic units to each sector. Integer programming models address the location-allocation problems, and various formulations implementing different criteria are compared. Methods to deal with multiobjective optimization problems, such as the (Formula presented.) -constraint, the lexicographic, and the weighted sum methods, are applied and compared. Computational results obtained for a set of benchmarking instances of sectorization problems are also presented.",Mathematics,2023-06-01,10.3390/math11112553
The influence of supply chain immunity perceptions on COVID-19 vaccine willingness in supply chain professionals,"Purpose: This study examines the lack of confidence in the actions of the government and pharmaceutical companies during vaccine deployment. The authors introduce the concept of supply chain immunity. The authors test whether the perception of higher vaccine supply chain immunity leads to higher willingness to be vaccinated within the supply chain community. Design/methodology/approach: The authors utilize factor analysis and item response theory methods to develop a scale for measuring supply chain immunity. The original and psychometrically sound scale is tested via a structural equation model (SEM). Factor analysis and SEM use survey responses from two samples of 125 supply chain executives. Findings: SEM suggests that supply chain immunity perceptions are a strong predictor of overall supply chain confidence for COVID vaccines. Further, these perceptions, through supply chain confidence, indirectly impact individuals' self-reported willingness to personally accept a vaccine themselves. Originality/value: This paper presents the concept of supply chain immunity perceptions that have not been used in the medical supply chain literature. This paper presents a first-of-a-kind scale for supply chain immunity perceptions utilizing nascent methods and demonstrates the constructs impact on vaccine program confidence and public willingness to participate.",International Journal of Logistics Management,2023-01-18,10.1108/IJLM-03-2022-0111
Design an Indoor Positioning System Using ESP32 Ultra-Wide Band Module,"In recent years, Indoor Positioning Systems have always captivated a colossal repercussion on many end-user applications such as medical healthcare, logistic and warehouse, smart buildings, military, etc. In particular, indoor tracking often requires high accurate localization. However, positioning precision is restricted by various hindrances within the mise-en-scène, especially the Non-Line-Of-Sight context which affects signal dispersion and occlusions.

Study and Analysis of Discrete Event-Driven Autonomous System with a Case Study for a Robotics Task,"Highly probabilistic, potential, and dynamic domains are only relatively known to contribute classical techniques for complex system establishment impossible. Currently available technologies and strategies do not adequately address these novel needs. Thus, by enabling autonomous systems to adapt, decision-making and learning abilities, we can empower them with sufficient and appropriate expertise to recognize and address such issues. To address these requirements, discrete event-driven systems (DEDS) have been developed. This system can help the technologists of future autonomous systems by simulating the effect of auxiliary designs on the performance of the autonomous system.

Mobile healthcare service planning in rural areas: A hybrid record to record travel algorithm,"Due to the economic infeasibility of establishing comprehensive healthcare facilities in sparsely populated areas and the responsibility of governments to ensure equal healthcare access for citizens, different approaches have been sought in healthcare service delivery. The Republic of Turkiye's Ministry of Health provides mobile healthcare services (MHS) to 9 million people monthly through 3400 healthcare facilities and 7500 doctors. This study focuses on the Mobile Healthcare Service Routing and Scheduling Problem (MHS-RSP). The objective of MHS-RSP is to determine the daily routes of doctors on a monthly basis to minimize total distance traveled, taking into account constraints such as working hours, route time, minimum service time per visit, and dedicated doctor assignments to villages. A mixed-integer mathematical model is developed to address the problem, which is NP-hard and equivalent to the multi-depot time-constrained periodic vehicle routing problem. To solve medium- and large-sized problems efficiently, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm named ""GCH-RRT"" is introduced, based on greedy constructive heuristic(GCH) and record-to-record travel(RRT) metaheuristic. The performance of the mathematical model and the GCH-RRT algorithm is compared with existing service plans in Ankara, resulting in a 15.6% improvement with the mathematical model and a 22.3% improvement with the GCH-RRT algorithm in total distance traveled.",Journal of the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture of Gazi University,2023-01-01,10.17341/gazimmfd.1218090
Hybridizing a matheuristic with ALNS for the optimal collection and delivery of medical specimens,"The past few years of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak have shown that optimal management of medical specimens is a key aspect of healthcare logistics, both for addressing the delivery of perishable items such as vaccines, and for ensuring the timely analysis of swabs and samples. Accordingly, recent optimization literature described the problem of optimal collection and delivery of medical specimens, modeled as a multitrip vehicle routing problem with time windows and a completion time objective function. Aiming to achieve good-quality solutions in short computational times, this work describes a hybrid approach, combining a matheuristic construction phase with an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS). Our matheuristic relies on a clustering algorithm to yield subsets of the medical specimens that are optimally served by single vehicles of the fleet. The solutions of the matheuristic phase serve as starting points for the ALNS intensification phase. Extensive experimentation on both new and established benchmark problem instances shows that our hybrid method is able to match the optimality of the state of the art on small instances and outperforms the existing exact method by one order of magnitude on larger problems.",International Transactions in Operational Research,2023-01-01,10.1111/itor.13386
Improved energy efficiency in D2D healthcare communication,"This paper addresses the minimization of energy consumption in device-to-device (D2D) communications in the healthcare logistics domain. Given the vital importance of actions in this field for patients' lives, it is crucial to reduce the energy consumed by the devices used. This study aims to propose a fuzzy approach to predict the energy consumption induced by different protocols in D2D communications to minimize the energy consumption of healthcare logistics devices. A fuzzy supervisor is developed to evaluate and forecast the energy consumption of the devices in D2D communications. This approach allows for obtaining more accurate predictions and a better understanding of how device energy consumption can be reduced. Numerical simulations were conducted to validate the proposed method. The results show the efficiency and sustainability of D2D communication systems and a significant reduction in energy consumption when a classical method is applied.",International Journal of Advances in Soft Computing and its Applications,2023-01-01,10.15849/IJASCA.230720.08
Drivers and Barriers to Implementing the Internet of Things in the Health Care Supply Chain: Mixed Methods Multicase Study,"Background: Over the past 2 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed enormous pressure on the health care industry. There has been an increase in demand and, at the same time, a shortage of supplies. This has shown that supply chain management in the health care industry cannot be taken for granted. Furthermore, the health care industry is also facing other major challenges, such as the current labor market shortage. In the literature, the Internet of Things (IoT) is highlighted as an effective tool to build a more resilient and efficient supply chain that can manage these challenges. Although using IoT in supply chain management has been extensively examined in other types of supply chains, its use in the health care supply chain has largely been overlooked. Given that the health care supply chain, compared to others, is more complex and is under growing pressure, a more in-depth understanding of the opportunities brought by IoT is necessary. Objective: This study aims to address this research gap by identifying and ranking the drivers of and barriers to implementing IoT in the health care supply chain. Methods: We conducted a 2-stage study. In the first, exploratory stage, a total of 12 semistructured interviews were conducted to identify drivers and barriers. In the second, confirmatory stage, a total of 26 health care supply chain professionals were asked in a survey to rank the drivers and barriers. Results: The results show that there are multiple financial, operational, strategy-related, and supply chain-related drivers for implementing IoT. Similarly, there are various financial, strategy-related, supply chain-related, technology-related, and user-related barriers. The findings also show that supply chain-related drivers (eg, increased transparency, traceability, and collaboration with suppliers) are the strongest drivers, while financial barriers (eg, high implementation costs and difficulties in building a business case) are the biggest barriers to overcome. Conclusions: The findings of this study add to the limited literature regarding IoT in the health care supply chain by empirically identifying the most important drivers and barriers to IoT implementation. The ranking of drivers and barriers provides guidance for practitioners and health care provider leaders intending to implement IoT in the health care supply chain.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,2023-01-01,10.2196/48730

Future healthcare logistics: a survey of the public opinion on drones in Denmark,"Drones are expected to become widespread in society, making public readiness an important prerequisite for successfully unleashing them. This article investigates Danish citizens’ opinions on drones across varying fields of application and, specif-ically, six potential cases of healthcare logistics. Survey data representative of age, gender, and geography were collected and included information about respondents’ background, knowledge level of drones, and opinions on different drone use cases. Data were analysed with frequency tables and bivariate cross-tabulation. A thousand and four Danish adults completed the survey. Although other fields of application received higher levels of support, a majority of the respondents were positive towards using drones for healthcare logistics. Transportation of medicine and blood samples between hospitals were the most accepted healthcare use cases. Support varies across age with the highest support found in the eldest age group. Also, the more citizens report to know about drones, the more they tend to support using them. The results suggest that policymakers and firms must be attentive towards the public opinion on drones and seek insights into what citizens regard as noble purposes of using drones. Moreover, citizens must become more acquainted with drones, as this will likely boost public support.",Drone Systems and Applications,2023-01-01,10.1139/dsa-2022-0050
Transforming healthcare logistics and evaluating current use cases of UAVs (drones) as a method of transportation in healthcare to generate recommendations for the NHS to use drone technology at scale: a narrative review,"Drones have been pioneered and used in the military, however, only recently non-military drones have been introduced. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into focus the potential value of drones in moving medical supplies. With the onset of social distancing policies and quarantine regulations, the efficiency of traditional logistics systems has been limited. Several companies have recently accelerated their development in this domain, conducting pilot projects at pace, paving the way for the future of the medical logistics supply chain. In this review, we examine both narrative and grey literature for in and out of hospital settings, in order to describe the current state of drone technology in healthcare around the world and some of the most cutting-edge examples of how drones can benefits patients, clinicians and the wider public. We investigate the economic viability and barriers to adopting drones at scale which include regulatory hurdles, public perception and safety of drone technologies, and propose how to overcome these challenges. Further work should look at quantifying the impact and outcomes of how such a service could impact the health outcomes of patients and clinical efficiency. This review aims to equip the National Health Service and more broadly other healthcare systems around the world with the tools to embrace and implement this novel and upcoming technology.",BMJ Innovations,2023-01-01,10.1136/bmjinnov-2021-000861
Reorganisation of the internal storage and distribution logistics in a hospital,"This study involved the analysis and improvement of the internal distribution and storage at Hospital da Senhora da Oliveira - Guimaraes, a 500-beds general hospital in the north of Portugal. The study evolved around an action-research strategy that comprised five sequential and interconnected phases. Initially, the internal supply chain of the hospital was analysed with a special focus on ward warehouses (WW) and data about the logistics processes of the WW were gathered. Following, a prototype WW to test a set of innovative solutions aimed at dealing with the difficulties identified in the previous phase was developed. The proposed improvements were analysed and then implemented in the WW of a health care department, which lead to a new data collection about the performance of the logistics processes. The implementation of the proposed solutions resulted in a reduction of the time spent collecting, debiting and storing materials of 55% to 66%. It was also possible to reduce the error rate in these processes by 93%. When the proposed solutions are expanded to the whole hospital, in a year, it will be possible to save 4,819 hours in WW logistics processes (that can be dedicated to provide care to patients) and to avoid 115,843 errors",Procedia Computer Science,2023-01-01,10.1016/j.procs.2023.01.421
TOWARD MORE REALISTIC SIMULATION MODELS USING OBJECT-CENTRIC PROCESS MINING,"Discrete-event simulation has been around for over half a century with applications in production, healthcare, logistics, transportation, etc. However, it is still challenging to create a reliable simulation model that mimics the actual process well and allows for “what-if” questions. Process mining allows for the automated discovery of stochastic process models using event data extracted from information systems. This technology is one of the key enablers for creating digital shadows and digital twins of operational processes. However, traditional process mining focuses on individual cases (e.g., an order, a patient, or a train) with events just referring to a single object (the case). Therefore, the discipline is moving to Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM), where events can refer to any number of objects. Based on research on OCPM and the prototypes developed, now also commercial software vendors are embracing OCPM, as illustrated by Celonis Process Sphere, which allows for the discovery and analysis of object-centric process models. We believe that OCPM will help to create much more realistic simulation models. Whereas process discovery is backward-looking, with object-centric simulation models, we can also support forward-looking forms of process mining. Although such techniques still need to be developed, they provide a unique opportunity to create more realistic digital twins of organizations and their processes.","Proceedings - European Council for Modelling and Simulation, ECMS",2023-01-01,
Bridging the Performance Gap Between Two-Way and One-Way CSI-Based 5 GHz WiFi Ranging,"Indoor Localization is gaining increased importance due to numerous location-based services in healthcare, logistics, and security, to name few, that are expected to be provided by next-generation wireless networks. Such services are characterized by stringent accuracy requirements, short response time, and lower cost which makes the localization problem more challenging and deserving of attention. A key element of the localization process is distance estimation (also known as ranging). In this paper, we design and analyze an efficient decimeter-level two-way ranging scheme for ubiquitous WiFi networks in the 5 GHz frequency band whose accuracy approaches ideal one-way ranging with no phase mismatches. We investigate the idea of channel frequency response (CFR) stitching across non-contiguous WiFi channels and how two-way CFR measurements help in achieving the CFR coherency necessary for accurate ranging. In addition, we quantify the decrease in ranging accuracy of two-way compared to one-way ranging due to SNR degradation, Line-of-Sight (LoS) component shrinkage, and doubling the multipath delay spread. Furthermore, We design a novel scheme to bridge the performance gap between two-way ranging and ideal one-way ranging which operates in three main steps: square-root of the two-way CFR, followed by phase unwrapping, and finally deep fade detection and phase errors correction. Our proposed scheme achieves significant performance gains over two-way ranging with only a slight performance gap from ideal one-way ranging. Moreover, our proposed scheme enjoys robustness as it preserves the ranging accuracy gains in various WiFi communication scenarios when operating at different SNR levels, different multipath channel models, and different CFR bandwidths, as well as operating under system impairments such as Sample Timing Offset (STO). The accuracy gains achieved by the proposed schemes are demonstrated using both simulations and an in-house WiFi testbed. Finally, we quantify the added complexity of our proposed scheme and show it to be insignificant compared to that of the MUSIC super-resolution ranging steps which confirms the practical viability of our proposed scheme.",IEEE Access,2023-01-01,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3287850
Robotics Systems and Healthcare Logistics,"Including waste management, warehousing, inventory management, equipment maintenance, sanitation, and transportation, healthcare logistics has focused on providing more innovative and value-added services in recent years. Therefore healthcare services should be examined and aligned with the objectives of the entire healthcare supply chain to meet the needs of both individuals and organizations. This will help to improve the supply chain performance so that reflects on the patient outcomes. Lack of efficient storage areas, increasing wages/salaries, and some activities that are conducted by healthcare employees manually are the priority areas that require solutions. According to studies in the field of health logistics, supply chain activities take more than the time spent on patient care. In addition, the logistics activities that have to be done manually by the health personnel leave a negative impression on the patients. Based on these, healthcare logistics should be improved in order to decrease the level of fatigue of healthcare personnel and create more time to interact with patients. Serving various tasks and purposes in many business sector, robots are preparing to become one of the most important technological innovations for healthcare industry. Nowadays, the robotics community is largely focused on developing the next generation of service and social robots. It is predicted that the use of robots in diagnostics, surgery, rehabilitation, patient care, disinfection and cleaning, medicine and food distribution, vital signs measurement, disease prevention, and disease management will increase performance in healthcare services. Among these, robots providing disinfection and logistics services are predicted to have the shortest-term impact.","Accounting, Finance, Sustainability, Governance and Fraud",2023-01-01,10.1007/978-981-99-1818-8_7

The Dial-a-Ride Problem with School Bell Time Adjustment,"In this paper, we study a paratransit application in which children are transported every day from their homes to their special schools or medical-social establishments. To optimize this transportation system, the establishments collaborate to propose a joint transportation plan. We propose a new algorithm to jointly build vehicle routes that visit several establishments and simultaneously set the establishments’ opening hours. This algorithm combines a large neighborhood search, the resolution of a route-based model, and the progressive shrinkage of the planning window. It is applied to a real case from the area of Lyon in France, including 34 schools and 575 heterogeneous users served by a heterogeneous fleet of reconfigurable vehicles. On average, we show that in addition to the 10% of saving that can be expected by sharing vehicle routes between schools, 7% of additional savings can be achieved by school bell adjustment. This cost saving also decreases average user ride times and the number of vehicles required, creating longer routes that are more attractive for driver services.",Transportation Science,2023-01-01,10.1287/trsc.2022.1160
Simheuristic and learnheuristic algorithms for the temporary-facility location and queuing problem during population treatment or testing events,"Epidemic outbreaks, such as the one generated by the coronavirus disease, have raised the need for more efficient healthcare logistics. One of the challenges that many governments have to face in such scenarios is the deployment of temporary medical facilities across a region with the purpose of providing medical services to their citizens. This work tackles this temporary-facility location and queuing problem with the goals of minimising costs, the expected completion time, population travel time, and waiting time. The completion time for a facility depends on the numbers assigned to those facilities as well as stochastic arrival times. This work proposes a learnheuristic algorithm to solve the facility location and population assignment problem. Firstly a machine learning algorithm is trained using data from a queuing model (simulation module). The learnheuristic then constructs solutions using the machine learning algorithm to rapidly evaluate decisions in terms of facility completion and population waiting times. The efficiency and quality of the algorithm is demonstrated by comparison with exact and simulation-only (simheuristic) methodologies. A series of experiments are performed which explore the trade-offs between solution cost, completion time, population travel time, and waiting time.",Journal of Simulation,2023-01-01,10.1080/17477778.2023.2166879

The impact of the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Australian trans community,"Background: Trans and gender diverse individuals (people who identify with a gender different to what was presumed for them at birth) are one of the most medically and socially marginalized groups in our community. The COVID-19 pandemic may compound preexisting depression and thoughts of self-harm or suicide. Aim: We aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Australian trans community. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted between 1st May 2020 and 30th June 2020, amidst strict Australia-wide social restrictions. Australian trans people aged ≥16 years were eligible to participate. Survey questions explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on living situation, employment, financial situation, and healthcare. Logistic regression to assess negative impacts due to COVID-19 on depression and thoughts of self-harm or suicide (measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) are presented as odds ratios (95% confidence interval)). Results: Of 1019 participants, 49.6% reported experiencing financial strain, 22% had reduced working hours, and 22.4% were unemployed (three times the national rate). Concerningly, 61.1% experienced clinically significant symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≥10), considerably higher than pre-COVID rates for the trans community and over twice the national rate. Moreover, 49% reported thoughts of self-harm or suicide (over three times the national rate) which was more likely if a person experienced cancelation or postponement of gender-affirming surgery (OR 1.56 (1.04, 2.35)), financial strain (OR 1.80 (1.36, 2.38)), or felt unsafe or afraid in their household (OR 1.96 (1.23, 3.08)). Discussion: Given rates of clinically significant depression and thoughts of self-harm or suicide are far higher in trans people than the general population, specific strategies to improve mental health in the trans community during the COVID-19 pandemic must be made a priority for policymakers, researchers, and health service providers to prevent suicide.

How important is income in explaining individuals having forgone healthcare due to cost-sharing payments? Results from a mixed methods sequential explanatory study,"Background: Patients having forgone healthcare because of the costs involved has become more prevalent in recent years. Certain patient characteristics, such as income, are known to be associated with a stronger demand-response to cost-sharing. In this study, we first assess the relative importance of patient characteristics with regard to having forgone healthcare due to cost-sharing payments, and then employ qualitative methods in order to understand these findings better. Methods: Survey data was collected from a Dutch panel of regular users of healthcare. Logistic regression models and dominance analyses were performed to assess the relative importance of patient characteristics, i.e., personal characteristics, health, educational level, sense of mastery and financial situation. Semi-structured interviews (n = 5) were conducted with those who had forgone healthcare. The verbatim transcribed interviews were thematically analyzed. Results: Of the 7,339 respondents who completed the questionnaire, 1,048 respondents (14.3%) had forgone healthcare because of the deductible requirement. The regression model indicated that having a higher income reduced the odds of having forgone recommended healthcare due to the deductible (odds ratios of higher income categories relative to the lowest income category (reference): 0.29–0.49). However, dominance analyses revealed that financial leeway was more important than income: financial leeway contributed the most (34.8%) to the model’s overall McFadden’s pseudo-R2 (i.e., 0.123), followed by income (25.6%). Similar results were observed in stratified models and in population weighted models. Qualitative analyses distinguished four main themes that affected the patient’s decision whether to use healthcare: financial barriers, structural barriers related to the complex design of cost-sharing programs, individual considerations of the patient, and the perceived lack of control regarding treatment choices within a given treatment trajectory. Furthermore, “having forgone healthcare” seemed to have a negative connotation. Conclusion: Our findings show that financial leeway is more important than income with respect to having forgone recommended healthcare due to cost-sharing payments, and that other factors such as the perceived necessity of healthcare also matter. Our findings imply that solely adapting cost-sharing programs to income levels will only get one so far. Our study underlines the need for a broader perspective in the design of cost-sharing programs.",BMC Health Services Research,2022-12-01,10.1186/s12913-022-07527-z

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Adaptation to Facilitate Healthcare Supply Chains in Low-Income Countries,"Low-income countries are persistently suffering from last-mile logistics issues in healthcare supply chains. Therefore, it is high time to explore technological applications to overcome such inadequacies. The faster speed, low maintenance cost, and absence of road dependency in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have popularized them as an alternative to road delivery. Hence, it is suggested as a solution to overcome the persisting distribution inefficiencies in healthcare logistics of low-income countries. According to the case study analysis conducted on the Sri Lankan vaccine cold chain, incorporating UAVs increases truck-space utilization and reduces the time consumed, cost incurred, and carbon dioxide emission in a delivery round. Moreover, the most suitable way to cover the initial setup cost of an unmanned aerial system (UAS) is by receiving aid from international donors. The capital cost also can be covered by government investments or via service outsourcing only if the number of flights per year is increased. Moreover, a homogenous (i.e., only UAV) solution was revealed to be more beneficial than a heterogeneous (i.e., truck and UAV) solution. However, due to the lack of technology literacy and willingness to change in low-income countries, it is recommended to initially execute a heterogeneous solution and expand to a homogeneous plan in the future years. However, it was evident that for a mixed-fleet solution to be advantageous, drone characteristics play a vital role. Hence, a UAV with specifications ideal for the use case must be utilized to garner the maximum benefits. Nevertheless, it was apparent that with the right implementation plan, UAVs possess the potential to overcome the shortcomings in the healthcare logistics of low-income countries.",Drones,2022-11-01,10.3390/drones6110321
Cooperative Blood Inventory Ledger (CoBIL): A decentralized decision-making framework for improving blood product management,"Inefficiencies in blood product management systems, including segmented operations, lack of detailed data sharing, and limited real-time visibility, can often result in significant annual losses in product wastage and postponed medical procedures. Left unaddressed, the negative impact on patient health and healthcare systems can be substantial as blood donations continue to decline. This paper proposes the Cooperative Blood Inventory Ledger (CoBIL), a blockchain and smart-contract enabled system designed to mitigate some of these inefficiencies by increasing cooperation among all echelons of the blood supply chain, without sacrificing entity privacy and competition. The proposed framework facilitates collaborative decision-making among all stakeholders to distribute blood products across healthcare networks and reduce system costs. It also facilitates product redistribution among hospitals and other transfusion points to reduce losses due to expired product or canceled medical procedures due to product shortages. A role-based smart contract is included in the framework to define stakeholder access and manage data exchange. To analyze the feasibility of the proposed framework, we implement a proof of concept on a local machine using Hyperledger fabric's test network and employ it to simulate transactions required for the inventory operations of a regional blood supply chain.",Computers and Industrial Engineering,2022-10-01,10.1016/j.cie.2022.108571
The impact of counterfeit risk management on healthcare supply chain performance: an empirical analysis,"Purpose: This study develops and tests a model exploring the relationship between supply chain (SC) counterfeit risk management and performance in the healthcare supply chain (HCSC). Design/methodology/approach: In the proposed theoretical model, HCSC counterfeit risk management is characterized by HCSC counterfeit risk orientation (HCRO), HCSC counterfeit risk mitigation (HCRM) and HCSC risk management integration (HRMI), while performance is represented by healthcare logistics performance (HLP) and healthcare organization overall performance (HOP). Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and survey data from 55 HCSC managers are used to test the research hypotheses. Findings: HCRO has a significant positive effect on HCRM, while HCRM has a positive impact on HRMI. With respect to HLP, HCRM has a nonsignificant effect, while HRMI has a significant impact, thus confirming the important mediating role of HRMI. Finally, HLP has a significant positive effect on the overall performance of healthcare organizations. Research limitations/implications: All study participants were from the United States, limiting the generalizability of the study findings to different countries or regions. The sample size employed in the study did not allow the authors to distinguish among the different types of healthcare organizations. Originality/value: This study delineates between a healthcare organization's philosophy toward counterfeiting risks vs actions taken to eliminate or reduce the impact of counterfeiting on the HCSC.

The multi-trip vehicle routing problem with increasing profits for the blood transportation: An iterated local search metaheuristic,"This paper studies a multi-trip routing problem of a shuttle fleet to transport blood units from collection sites to a blood center. In this problem, the blood units intended to produce platelets and cryoprecipitate must be processed within eight hours from their donation and arrive at the blood center at a time less than its closing time to guarantee enough processing time. Since it is assumed that blood units are donated at a collection site following a constant ratio over its operating hours, this problem is modeled as a multi-trip vehicle routing problem with increasing profits for which a mixed-integer linear programming formulation is proposed. A hybrid iterated local search metaheuristic and an extended version are developed as solution methods. The extended version includes a mixed-integer linear programming component into the local search of the hybrid metaheuristic to optimize the decision on the departure times of the trips.

Transportation-Induced Carbon Emissions Jeopardize Healthcare Logistics Sustainability: Toward a Healthier Today and a Better Tomorrow,"Background: Logistics operations are considered essential for transporting commodities from one location to another, helping to promote global economic activity. On the other hand, its negative impact eclipses its positive impact, namely the rise in healthcare expenditures due to its ecological footprint. Globally, rising out-of-pocket health expenses result from logistic-induced carbon emissions, posing a danger to the long-term viability of healthcare. Methods: Based on this critical fact, this study examined the impact of logistics operations on healthcare costs by controlling for carbon emissions, fuel imports, and economic development across a large cross-section of 131 nations by using the Robust Least Squares Regression. Results: The findings demonstrate a U-shaped association between logistical operations and healthcare expenditures, i.e., if there is a 1% increase in logistics operations, healthcare expenditures decrease by −2.421% initially, while at later stages, healthcare costs would increase by 0.139%. On the other hand, increased fuel imports and economic growth due to logistics activities are increasing healthcare expenditures with an elasticity estimate of 0.087% and 0.147%, respectively. According to the forecasting predictions, logistics-induced carbon emissions, fuel imports, and economic expansion will increase healthcare expenses. Conclusions: A sustainable logistics operation is critical for strengthening healthcare infrastructure and meeting the global carbon neutrality goal.",Logistics,2022-06-01,10.3390/logistics6020027
Stochastic medical tourism problem with variable residence time considering gravity function,"Medical tourism is a recent term in healthcare logistics referring to travel of patients to receive health services and spending leisure time in a destination country. This transferring of patients leads to access high-quality health services which are cheaper than the original country of patients. During this travel, passengers who are the patients from another country, have this opportunity for complimentary entertainment packages (e.g., pleasure tours) in the aftercare period. As far as we know, the term of medical tourism is rarely studied in healthcare logistics and such services are highly important for developing countries. Such facts motivate us to develop a practical optimization model for the Medical Tour Centers (MTCs) for allocation of patients to hospitals in proper time and creation of memorable aftercare time for them. In this regard, the main aim of the proposed model is to maximize the total profit of MTCs through optimal allocation of patients to hospitals while considering an aftercare tour for the passengers. To make the proposed model more realistic, the optimal residence time in attractive places is simulated by a time-dependent gravity function. To address the uncertainty of medical tourism problem, a scenario-based two-stage stochastic optimization approach is extended to encounter different sources of uncertainty existing in surgical success, medical time, restoration restrictions, and the attraction of tourist places. Another novelty of this work is to propose an innovative hybrid meta-heuristic for large-scale instances, which is a combination of Progressive Hedging Algorithm (PHA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The model is analyzed by different test problems for small, medium, and large-scale instances where the hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm could solve them with an average gap of 3.4% in comparison with the commercial solver. The results revealed the importance of tourist opinion and public preferences in medical and pleasure tours, respectively, to improve the economic growth in this sector in developing countries.",RAIRO - Operations Research,2022-05-01,10.1051/ro/2022082
Fleet sizing and routing of healthcare automated guided vehicles,"This paper proposes techniques to improve the efficiency of transportation activities within hospitals. Transportation is a major activity in hospitals which requires management efforts to improve its efficiency and increase the quality of patient services. One of the most powerful ways of achieving more efficiency of transportation systems in hospitals is via the labor-saving technology of logistics processes using automated guided vehicles (AGVs). In this paper, we study the fleet sizing and routing problem with synchronization for AGVs with dynamic demands (FSRPS-AGV) in the context of a real-life application. The goal is to simultaneously optimize the number and types of carts and AGVs needed to perform all daily requests in a hospital while optimizing AGVs’ routes and respecting time constraints. Different requests require different types of carts, which are transported by the AGVs. Each request is composed of several tasks consisting of moving material from a pickup point to a delivery point. Operation synchronization among the tasks of the same request (task 1 must be performed before task 2, possibly by different AGVs but using the same cart) and movement synchronization with respect to AGVs and carts (an AGV may drop off a cart, and later another AGV picks up the cart to continue serving the same or another request) are major challenges of the addressed problem. In this paper, we describe, model, and solve the FSRPS-AGV. We introduce a mathematical formulation and propose a powerful matheuristic based on a fast and efficient dynamic reoptimization of the routes upon the arrival of new requests. We compare the performance of our matheuristic under different scenarios, including against the solutions obtained by an oracle, showing that it can handle dynamism of demand very well and achieve near-optimal solutions. We assess our methods using small and large instances generated based on real data from an industrial partner. We demonstrate that significant performance improvements and important savings can be achieved with a small degree of flexibility in timing constraints and less conservative speed estimations (while taking into account safety concerns). Finally, we provide managerial insights with respect to the number of AGVs and carts that should be acquired by our industrial partner.",Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,2022-05-01,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102679
Sustainable and Robust Home Healthcare Logistics: A Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Today, research on healthcare logistics is an important challenge in developing and developed countries, especially when a pandemic such as COVID-19 occurs. The responses required during such a pandemic would benefit from an efficiently designed model for robust and sustainable healthcare logistics. In this study, we focus on home healthcare logistics and services for planning the routing and scheduling of caregivers to visit patients’ homes. Due to the need for social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, these services are highly applicable for reducing the growth of the epidemic. In addition to this challenge, home healthcare logistics and services must be redesigned to meet the standards of a triple bottom line approach based on sustainable development goals. A triple bottom line approach finds a balance between economic, environmental, and social criteria for making a sustainable decision. Although, recently, the concept of green home healthcare has been studied based on the total cost and green emissions of home healthcare logistics and services, as far as we know, no research has been conducted on the formulation of a triple bottom line approach for home healthcare logistics and services. To achieve social justice for caregivers, the goal of balancing working time is to find a balance between unemployment time and overtime. Another contribution of this research is to develop a scenario-based robust optimization approach to address the uncertainty of home healthcare logistics and services and to assist with making robust decisions for home healthcare planning. Since our multi-objective optimization model for sustainable and robust home healthcare logistics and services is more complex than other studies, the last novel contribution of this research is to establish an efficient heuristic algorithm based on the Lagrangian relaxation theory. An initial solution is found by defining three heuristic algorithms. Our heuristic algorithms use a symmetric pattern for allocating patients to pharmacies and planning the routing of caregivers. Then, a combination of the epsilon constraint method and the Lagrangian relaxation theory is proposed to generate high-quality Pareto-based solutions in a reasonable time period. Finally, an extensive analysis is done to show that our multi-objective optimization model and proposed heuristic algorithm are efficient and practical, as well as some sensitivities are studied to provide some managerial insights for achieving sustainable and robust home healthcare services in practice.",Symmetry,2022-02-01,10.3390/sym14020193
Improved renal cancer prognosis among users of drugs targeting renin-angiotensin system,"Purpose: We explored renal cell cancer (RCC) survival among users of antihypertensive medication as hypertension is proposed to be a risk factor for RCC and ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been associated with improved prognosis of RCC. Methods: Finnish cohort of 13,873 participants with RCC diagnosed between 1995–2012 was formed from three national databases. RCC cases were identified from Finnish Cancer Registry, medication usage from national prescription database and co-morbidities from Care Registry of Healthcare. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for metastatic tumor extent at the time of diagnosis. Risk of RCC specific death after diagnosis was analyzed using Cox regression adjusted for tumor clinical characteristics. Results: A total of 5,179 participants died of RCC during the follow-up. No risk association was found for metastatic tumor extent for any drug group. ACE-inhibitors, but no other drug group were associated with decreased risk of RCC specific death overall (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82–0.95) compared to non-users. In time-dependent analysis high-dose use of ACE-inhibitors (392 Defined Daily Dose (DDD)/year), HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.45–0.66) and ARBs (786.1 DDD/year, HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50–0.87) associated with improved RCC survival. No information of TNM-classification or tobacco smoking was available. Conclusion: ACE-inhibitors and ARBs in high dose associated with improved RCC specific survival. This may reflect overall benefit of treating hypertension with medication targeting renin-angiotensin system (RAS) system among RCC patients. Further studies are needed to explore the role of RAS in RCC.",Cancer Causes and Control,2022-02-01,10.1007/s10552-021-01527-w
Hospital-Location Classification and Analysis in the Healthcare Cold Chain using K-means Algorithm,"Logistics and supply chain management for the healthcare sector is concerned with activities related to production, storage, and distribution. Relevant stakeholders are from various parties, which are inclusive of material supplier, manufacturer, distribution center, regional hospital, provincial hospital, as well as patients. In this research, we analyze the locational data of hospital using a case study of hospitals in Thailand to evaluate potential locational center acting as a central storage and distribution centers. Initially, we apply the K-means algorithm to classify hospital locational data into a specified number of classification groups. Then, the location model based on rectilinear distance is formulated and minimized to evaluate potential locations for the central storage and distribution centers. Our initial study provides promising result and is subject to the on-going development of the healthcare cold chain model in our research study.","8th International Conference on Engineering and Emerging Technologies, ICEET 2022",2022-01-01,10.1109/ICEET56468.2022.10007286
DEEP LEARNING FOR THE PREDICTION OF TRANS-BORDER LOGISTICS OF PATIENTS TO MEDICAL CENTERS,"Background: Covid 19 impacted many healthcare logistics systems. An enormous number of people suffer from the effect of a pandemic, infection diseases can spread rapidly within and between countries. People from the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Lao People's Democratic Republic are most likely to cross-border into Thailand for diagnosis and special treatment. In this situation, international referral cannot predict the volume of patients and their destination. Therefore, the aim of the research is to use deep learning to construct a model that predicts the travel demand of patients at the border. Methods: Based on previous emergency medical services, the prediction demand used the gravity model or the regression model. The novelty element in this research paper uses the neural network technique. In this study, a two-stage survey is used to collect data. The first phase interviews experts from the strategic group level of The Public Health Office. The second phase examines the patient?s behavior regarding route selection using a survey. The methodology uses deep learning training using the Sigmoid function and Identity function. The statistics of precision include the average percent relative error (APRE), the root mean square error (RMSE), the standard deviation (SD), and the correlation coefficient (R). Results: Deep learning is suitable for complex problems as a network. The model allows the different data sets to forecast the demand for the cross-border patient for each hospital. Equations are applied to forecast demand, in which the different hospitals require a total of 58,000 patients per year to be diagnosed by the different hospitals. The predictor performs better than the RBF and regression model. Conclusions: The novelty element of this research uses the deep learning technique as an efficient nonlinear model; moreover, it is suitable for dynamic prediction. The main advantage is to apply this model to predict the number of patients, which is the key to determining the supply chain of treatment; additionally, the ability to formulate guidelines with healthcare logistics effectively in the future.",Logforum,2022-01-01,10.17270/J.LOG.2022.689
Artificial Intelligence for Smart Cities: Locational Planning and Dynamic Routing of Emergency Vehicles,"To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of essential emergency services such as ambulances, fire brigades, and police, one of the most important problems to tackle is to minimize the response times of these emergency vehicles. As well as attaining optimal waiting sites and deployment strategies for the emergency vehicles, the optimal routing and traffic preemption of the vehicles are also crucial in minimizing response times and maximizing coverage. As locational planning and dynamic routing of the emergency vehicles relate to many different situations with varying emergency levels, they are a crucial part of the smart city concept. In this chapter, we present a perspective for the use of artificial intelligence and optimization in sustainable healthcare logistics within a smart city. We provide a survey of literature and identify many applications from around the globe. Related mathematical models and solution approaches are also presented, as necessary.","Accounting, Finance, Sustainability, Governance and Fraud",2022-01-01,10.1007/978-981-16-8997-0_3
A Locational Analysis Model of the COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution,"Even and equitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine becomes one of key strategies to reduce the number of positive cases and virus transmissions all over the world. This paper aims to introduce and demonstrate a mathematical model based on a maximal covering location problem (MCLP) to optimise the coverage of the COVID-19 vaccine distribution. A mathematical model is proposed and demonstrated using an illustrative case study of healthcare facilities and location coordinates of villages in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. A numerical computer experiment is conducted to obtain optimal results of the locational analysis. The results show that the proposed model provides an efficient coverage of vaccination by minimising the distances travelled by the target population. It also reveals an interesting insight that prioritising vaccination for areas with high COVID-19 cases results in a less efficient coverage. The novel location-allocation model for COVID-19 vaccination facilities proposed in this paper particularly applies in a developing country. The model could be used as an alternative way to increase the vaccination coverage and priority whilst minimising the potential risks of the virus transmissions and transport costs.",Operations and Supply Chain Management,2022-01-01,10.31387/oscm0490344
Request and Donation Efficiencies in a Crisis: Data Envelopment Analyses of a Philippine Web-Based Emergency Response System,"On March 16, 2020, the island of Luzon was placed under lockdown to curtail the spread of COVID-19 in the Philippines. Soon thereafter, a web-based emergency response platform was developed to counteract effects from the outbreak. As a free service to strengthen a debilitated national hospital supply chain, the platform connected community organizations (as hospitals) with donors (individuals). From concepts and techniques that addressed information flows in healthcare logistics and supply chain management, several input-oriented data envelopment analyses were conducted to find the efficiencies for each of the 75 hospitals serviced by the website in terms of donors, individual items requested, total quantity of items requested, number of requested individual items that received a pledged, and average days a request pended to fulfillment. Results from the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique found that hospitals on the platform made requests that exceeded optimal quantities of inputs from donors. Further, hospital requests aggregated at the city-level stood unanswered an average of 14.39 days for inefficiently served cities. Findings from the analyses produced three recommendations to improve the web-based emergency response system service efficiency. The first recommendation was to reallocate donors over more hospitals, such that a few hospitals did not receive a majority of donations. A second recommendation was to reduce the number of individually requested items. The third recommendation was to reduce the quantities of items requested in order to bring service efficiency to optimality.",Contributions to Economics,2022-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-89996-7_20
Optimising the booking horizon in healthcare clinics considering no-shows and cancellations,"Patient no-shows and cancellations are a significant problem to healthcare clinics, as they compromise a clinic's efficiency. Therefore, it is important to account for both no-shows and cancellations into the design of appointment systems. To provide additional empirical evidence on no-show and cancellation behaviour, we assess outpatient clinic data from two healthcare providers in the USA and EU: no-show and cancellation rates increase with the scheduling interval, which is the number of days from the appointment creation to the date the appointment is scheduled for. We show the temporal cancellation behaviour for multiple scheduling intervals is bimodally distributed. To improve the efficiency of clinics at a tactical level of control, we determine the optimal booking horizon such that the impact of no-shows and cancellations through high scheduling intervals is minimised, against a cost of rejecting patients. Where the majority of the literature only includes a fixed no-show rate, we include both a cancellation rate and a time-dependent no-show rate. We propose an analytical queuing model with balking and reneging, to determine the optimal booking horizon. Simulation experiments show that the assumptions of this model are viable. Computational results demonstrate general applicability of our model by case studies of two hospitals.",International Journal of Production Research,2022-01-01,10.1080/00207543.2021.1913292
Coordinating inventory sharing with retailer's return in the consignment contracts,"Hospitals purchase medical supplies from the dealer on consignment contracts. Dealer provides a return policy for unused inventory but charging a return fee. Two hospitals could share inventory which reduces the amount of return to the dealer. Motivated by this consignment contract policy for the medical supply chain, we develop a common dealer and two independent retailers framework that considers retailers' sharing action and return problem. We aim at developing a coordinating mechanism to manage the retailers' sharing and return action that benefits both the dealer and retailers. Dealer-dominated sharing and retailer-dominated sharing are compared from the perspective of sharing performance and expected profits. We also analyse the condition that the dealer is better off from retailers' sharing when the dealer has the power to encourage retailers' sharing, and the dealer's trading preference for a non-cooperative retailer or cooperative retailers when the dealer has no power to encourage retailers' sharing. Numerical experiments are conducted to examine the sensitivity of retailers' sharing decisions, retailers' and dealer's profit to the return price.",International Journal of Production Research,2022-01-01,10.1080/00207543.2020.1854485
Non-medical barriers in access to early steps of kidney transplantation in the United States – A scoping review,"Background: In the United States (US), barriers in access to later steps in the kidney transplantation process (i.e. waitlisting) have been well documented. Barriers in access to earlier steps (i.e. referral and evaluation) are less well described due to the lack of national surveillance data. In this review, we summarize the available literature on non-medical barriers in access to kidney transplant referral and evaluation. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a scoping review of the literature through June 3, 2021. We included all studies (quantitative and qualitative) reporting on barriers to kidney transplant referral and evaluation in the US published from 1990 onwards in English and among adult end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42014015027). We narratively synthesized results across studies. Results: We retrieved information from 33 studies published from 1990 to 2021 (reporting data between 1990 and 2018). Most studies (n = 28, 85%) described barriers among patient populations, three (9%) among provider populations, and two (6%) included both patients and providers. Key barriers were identified across multiple levels and included patient- (e.g. demographic, socioeconomic, sociocultural, and knowledge), provider- (e.g. miscommunication, staff availability, provider perceptions and attitudes), and system- (e.g. geography, distance to care, healthcare logistics) level factors. Conclusions: A multi-pronged approach (e.g. targeted and systemwide interventions, and policy change) implemented at multiple levels of the healthcare system will be necessary to reduce identified barriers in access to early kidney transplant steps. Collection of national surveillance data on these early kidney transplant steps is also needed to enhance our understanding of barriers to referral and evaluation.",Transplantation Reviews,2021-12-01,10.1016/j.trre.2021.100654
Interoperable permissioned-blockchain with sustainable performance,"Bitcoin is an innovative and path-breaking technology that has influenced numerous industries across the globe.

Impacts of Losses Functions on the Quality of the Ultrasound Image by Using Machine Learning Algorithms,"During last decade, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been able to reshape our life daily. Different areas were positively impacted by AI such as Healthcare, Logistic, etc. Medical imaging is one of the fields of healthcare in which AI was introduced to solve and overcome different problems. Challenges including image processing, signal processing, and data acquisition. In this paper, we deeply demonstrate the loss function as one of the main parameters that influence the quality of the ultrasound (US) image. Therefore, we introduce the main components of ultrasound systems form end-to-end perspective such as the data acquisition, the signal processing, and the image interpretation. Then, we present the losses functions as a critical performance metrics for the model validation. Metrics such as the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Cross-Entropy loss function (CE), Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), and the Structural Similarity (SSIM). After that we present the adopted CNN model to generate ultrasound image. The excessive simulation results demonstrate that the selection of the loss function provides significant improvement in terms of image quality (e.g., contrast, CNR and SNR). Choosing simple loss functions such as mean square error helps to faster the convergence of the convolution neural network during the training process. However, for image quality enhancement, we propose the combination of different loss functions such structural similarity (SSIM) with Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).","2021 IEEE International Conference on Automatic Control and Intelligent Systems, I2CACIS 2021 - Proceedings",2021-06-26,10.1109/I2CACIS52118.2021.9495878
Importance of 5G-enabled IoT for industrial automation,"5G-enabled IoT can make a significant contribution to society by providing and advancing intelligent services for human beings. The applications of 5G-enabled IoT range to all society segments, such as industry, agriculture, environment, traffic, healthcare, logistics, and many more. Thus, it comes up as a good topic to research and makes the masses aware of it. The scale by which human lives will be made more accessible, productive, secure, and healthy and the need for this to be brought forward by the masses serve as the motivation for this chapter. In this chapter, we describe 5G-enabled IoT and its importance in the modern industries. It should detail upon applications of 5G-enabled IoT, which are assumed to bring revolutions like smart cities, advanced healthcare, smart homes, automated agriculture, autonomous vehicles, intelligent supply chain management, and how all the applications will reduce cost and labor. We shall also briefly touch upon some of the disadvantages and some rumors of the upcoming fifth generation of the Internet, making the people stand against these modern technologies' uprise. 5G is the fifth generation of wireless technology. It is meant to provide very high data transfer speeds and more reliable networks, seamlessly connect a massive number of embedded sensors, and provide extremely low-cost connectivity solutions. The Internet of Things is a system of computing devices, sensors, etc. which are connected via the Internet and can communicate with each other, i.e., transfer data without any human intervention. However, with the advent of 5G, IoT is meant to go through revolutionary changes. 5G will enable us to remotely control a more significant number of devices and allow data transfers at benchmark speeds in applications where real-time network performance is critical. Thus, 5G will bring out the full potential of IoT. 5G-enabled IoT will leave a lasting expression in fields of automation, machine intelligence, and smart systems. As mentioned above, domains like smart cities, autonomous vehicles, automated factories, intelligent machine tools, augmented and virtual reality, healthcare, etc. are going to experience substantial technological advancements with the advent of 5G-enabled IoT systems. Innovation in the automation industry would boom as they have increased the use of IoT to connect cars, connecting with traffic and road services, etc. This vast increase in connected devices requires a superior network to manage it in overall speed, capacity, and latency.

Six-Sigma Quality Management of Additive Manufacturing,"Quality is a key determinant in deploying new processes, products, or services and influences the adoption of emerging manufacturing technologies. The advent of additive manufacturing (AM) as a manufacturing process has the potential to revolutionize a host of enterprise-related functions from production to the supply chain. The unprecedented level of design flexibility and expanded functionality offered by AM, coupled with greatly reduced lead times, can potentially pave the way for mass customization. However, widespread application of AM is currently hampered by technical challenges in process repeatability and quality management. The breakthrough effect of six sigma (6S) has been demonstrated in traditional manufacturing industries (e.g., semiconductor and automotive industries) in the context of quality planning, control, and improvement through the intensive use of data, statistics, and optimization. 6S entails a data-driven DMAIC methodology of five steps - define, measure, analyze, improve, and control. Notwithstanding the sustained successes of the 6S knowledge body in a variety of established industries ranging from manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, and beyond, there is a dearth of concentrated application of 6S quality management approaches in the context of AM. In this article, we propose to design, develop, and implement the new DMAIC methodology for the 6S quality management of AM. First, we define the specific quality challenges arising from AM layerwise fabrication and mass customization (even one-of-a-kind production). Second, we present a review of AM metrology and sensing techniques, from materials through design, process, and environment, to postbuild inspection. Third, we contextualize a framework for realizing the full potential of data from AM systems and emphasize the need for analytical methods and tools. We propose and delineate the utility of new data-driven analytical methods, including deep learning, machine learning, and network science, to characterize and model the interrelationships between engineering design, machine setting, process variability, and final build quality. Fourth, we present the methodologies of ontology analytics, design of experiments (DOE), and simulation analysis for AM system improvements. In closing, new process control approaches are discussed to optimize the action plans, once an anomaly is detected, with specific consideration of lead time and energy consumption. We posit that this work will catalyze more in-depth investigations and multidisciplinary research efforts to accelerate the application of 6S quality management in AM.",Proceedings of the IEEE,2021-04-01,10.1109/JPROC.2020.3034519
Logistics chain optimization and scheduling of hospital pharmacy drugs using genetic algorithms: Morocco case,"In recent years, the health sector has faced increasingly important challenges. Due to the economic crisis and competitions, hospitals are facing many issues affecting the supply chain, such as budget cuts or lack thereof as well as insufficient human resources. Although essential for an excellent service, logistics take up a considerable part of the budget as challenges need to be addressed such as delays in drugs delivery, transportation and storage conditions, routing and scheduling. As to governance, each hospital is assigned to a specific region, which cannot be defined due to political, demographic, or geographic issues. This paper focuses on multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP) in healthcare logistics to feed the hospital pharmacies. The idea is to apply MDVRP’s approach to the health sector, specifically hospital pharmacies. In this projection, hospitals are considered to present clients, and central pharmacies present deposits. This problem (the MDVRP) is known by this nature NP-hard. For that, the heuristic method was used as genetic algorithm to solve the problem. The paper is organized as follows, the first section discusses, compares, and proposes clustering methods for healthcare facilities with applying them on Moroccan hospitals case; the second section proposes a genetic algorithm to resolve the MDVRP with a simulation.",International Journal of Web-Based Learning and Teaching Technologies,2021-03-01,10.4018/IJWLTT.2021030104

This is done using a framework based on a four-step approach adopted from workforce management in call centres. In addition, it is also shown that data-driven capacity planning allows for a more evenly spread workload for the care workers.","Integrating the Organization of Health Services, Worker Wellbeing and Quality of Care: Towards Healthy Healthcare",2021-01-25,10.1007/978-3-030-59467-1_8

From network approach to ecosystem approach: A new framework for change management,"The actual change management models drawn from literature are focused only on the perspective of a single organisation. This perspective is not coherent with the new business scenario created by the pervasive use of digital technologies, which requires a new way to deal with organizational change. In particular, organizations have to manage change in a collaborative way, reflecting a progressive shift from a network to an ecosystem approach. Starting from this perspective, this paper aim to present a change on management framework in order to manage innovation within a complex digital ecosystem of actors. Coherently with this goal, the proposed framework will be articulated in a series of phases that have to be considered in the change process within an ecosystem. For each phase, the research will present the most common issues faced by organizations together with the corresponding change management actions. These actions are categorized in short-term and long-term. Moreover, the paper provides a set of indicators that can be used to monitor the effectiveness of the various change management actions. Finally, the validity of the change management framework will be proved thanks to its application in a project of digital innovation in healthcare domain. This analysis will provide a concrete example on how change management can be accomplished throughout a specific digital ecosystem.","Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",2021-01-01,10.34190/EIE.21.077
Early Determinants of Length of Hospital Stay: A Case Control Survival Analysis among COVID-19 Patients admitted in a Tertiary Healthcare Facility of East India,"Background: Length of hospital stay (LOS) for a disease is a vital estimate for healthcare logistics planning. The study aimed to illustrate the effect of factors elicited on arrival on LOS of the COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: It was a retrospective, record based, unmatched, case control study using hospital records of 334 COVID-19 patients admitted in an East Indian tertiary healthcare facility during May to October 2020. Discharge from the hospital (cases/survivors) was considered as an event while death (control/non-survivors) as right censoring in the case-control survival analysis using cox proportional hazard model. Results: Overall, we found the median LOS for the survivors to be 8 days [interquartile range (IQR): 7-10 days] while the same for the non-survivors was 6 days [IQR: 2-11 days]. In the multivariable cox-proportional hazard model; travel distance (>16 km) [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 0.69, 95% CI: (0.50-0.95)], mode of transport to the hospital (ambulance) [aHR: 0.62, 95% CI: (0.45-0.85)], breathlessness (yes) [aHR: 0.56, 95% CI: (0.40-0.77)], number of co-morbidities (1-2) [aHR: 0.66, 95% CI: (0.47-0.93)] (≥3) [aHR: 0.16, 95% CI: (0.04-0.65)], COPD/asthma (yes) [[aHR: 0.11, 95% CI: (0.01-0.79)], DBP (<60/≥90) [aHR: 0.55, 95% CI: (0.35-0.86)] and qSOFA score (≥2) [aHR: 0.33, 95% CI: (0.12-0.92)] were the significant attributes affecting LOS of the COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Factors elicited on arrival were found to be significantly associated with LOS. A scoring system inculcating these factors may be developed to predict LOS of the COVID-19 patients.",Journal of Primary Care and Community Health,2021-01-01,10.1177/21501327211054281
Improving operational efficiency of pharmaceutical inventory,"The pharmaceutical inventory is one of the significant parts involved in hospital operations. However, the limitation of inventory space causes the complexity of inventory control. The purpose of this research is to improve the efficiency of Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital’s Pharmaceutical Inventory. The principle of ABC-VED Classification is applied in this research to prioritize the medicine inventory. Moreover, the optimal number of inventory is defined using Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), Safety Stock (SS), and Reorder Point (ROP).

Hybrid predetection technique for efficient tag identification in radio-frequency identification systems,"Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is a noncontact automatic identification technology that has been widely used in various modern industries. Due to the continuous improvement in sensing capabilities, energy autonomy, affordability, and usability, RFID is one of the key enabling technologies in realizing the Internet of Things (IoT). With their non-line-of-sight wireless transmission, wireless power, and sensing capability, lightweight RFID sensor tags can be connected to people or objects, which is crucial for future IoT applications such as healthcare, logistics, and manufacturing. The RFID approach with the simultaneous reading of multiple tag features can quickly identify connected “things” for further data communication and integration. Reducing the identification processing time for many tags located inside the interrogation range of the reader is essential. Therefore, an effective protocol must be developed to prevent collisions and reduce useless queries between the reader and tags to achieve rapid identification. Predetection tree-based algorithms, which are based on certain small predetection timeslots that tags can respond to, can eliminate unnecessary idle slots and prevent collision slots. In this paper, an efficient predetection-based anticollision algorithm has been proposed to achieve outstanding tag identification performance. The numbers of collision slots and idle slots are reduced by exploiting a novel predetection mechanism and slot size adjustment technique. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme reduces the tag identification time by approximately 30-60% compared with previously proposed predetection-based protocols. Moreover, the numbers of query cycles, collisions, and slots are smaller in the proposed scheme than in the previously proposed protocols.",Sensors and Materials,2021-01-01,10.18494/SAM.2021.3381
Hybrid Intelligent System for Medical Diagnosis in Health Care,"The autonomous city implies a global vision that incorporates artificial intelligence, deep learning, big data, decision-making, ICT and the Internet of Things (IoT) to promote sustainable development. The ageing issue is that researchers, companies and the government should devote efforts to developing smart health care, innovative technology and applications. For an extended period, conventional intelligence systems have played a critical role in health care. However, with the increased popularity and widespread use of these hybrid intelligent computer systems, there is a significant shift in the healthcare sector. Diagnosis and detection of various diseases using several techniques can be resolved by using these techniques. Different novel methods are applied to biomedical engineering to diagnose diseases, and new models are being studied and compared with the existing technologies. Hybrid intelligence systems can be implied in decision-making, remote monitoring, healthcare logistics, medical diagnosis, and modern information system. This success's fundamental cause seems to be derived by different intelligent computational mechanisms, such as genetic algorithms, evolutionary computation, convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), autoencoders, deep generative models and deep belief networks. To solve complex problems, we need domain knowledge that comprises the methodologies that provide hybrid systems with complementary reasoning and empirical data. This chapter will focus on the need for a hybrid intelligent system in the healthcare industry and their medical diagnosis applicability.",Intelligent Systems Reference Library,2021-01-01,10.1007/978-981-16-2972-3_2

Healthcare Logistics Optimization Framework for Efficient Supply Chain Management in Niger Delta Region of Nigeria,"Optimizing logistics allocation and utilization is essential for effective healthcare management. Apparently, less consideration is given to it in most hospitals in Nigeria where less resources are allocated to health sector in yearly budgetary. Hospital consists of several patient classes, each of which follows different treatment process flow paths over a multiphase and multidimensional requirement with scarce resources and inadequate space. Despite the small budget provision made for healthcare resources, patient’s demands for better service is rapidly experiencing upsurge. Hence, efficient and optimal solutions are required to lessen costs of healthcare service towards enhancing Quality of Care (QoC) and Quality of Experience (QoE) in most public healthcare sector. However, certain control coefficients like the absence of a Dedicated Logistics Department (DLD) in the medical facilities actually limit the efforts of stakeholders. This paper proposed a Computational framework to assess various strategic and operational decisions for optimizing the multiple objectives using Type-1 Fuzzy Logic Model. In phase I, we explore healthcare resource allocation plan. In phase II, we determine a resource utilization schedule by patient class for daily operational level. While in Phase III, we develop a framework capable of evaluating and optimizing healthcare logistics using control coefficients of Logistics Optimization (LO), Integration of Information/Cognitive Technologies (ETA), and Collaboration of all Logistics Stakeholders (COL). We assigned weights between 1 and 10 to the coefficients and modeled the effects on efficient supply chain. Finally, we further explore the effects of separate strategies and their combination to identify the best possible resource supply chain. The computational experiment was considered on the basis of data obtained from a study conducted on a typical public healthcare department. Results shows that our approach significantly evaluate and optimized healthcare logistics.",International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,2021-01-01,10.14569/IJACSA.2021.0120475

A quickly deployed and UAS-based logistics network for delivery of critical medical goods during healthcare system stress periods: A real use case in Valencia (Spain),"On the one hand, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) have experienced great applicability surge in the recent years, arising as a promising technology with a wide field of use. On the other hand, healthcare, a critical system in modern society, is subject to a heavy and unexpected pressure in the case of situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This article aims to leverage the flexibility of UASs as complementary support for healthcare logistic systems when under high-stress conditions, via quick deployment of an air delivery network. We have defined a logistics network model and created three scenarios based on the model and current needs in Valencia (Spain). Flight tests have been performed in these scenarios, which include urban areas and controlled airspace. Operations complied with requirements derived from the application of Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA) methodology, recently adopted by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Flights were successful, being able to swiftly deliver medical goods without requiring any dedicated infrastructure. However, a moderate number of contingencies took place during the tests, mainly related to control link quality and Air Traffic Management (ATM) integration, forcing the use of dedicated procedures to cope with them. Although additional development is required to ensure the safety of large-scale automated operations, the use of UASs as part of logistic networks is a feasible means to support existing structures, especially in situations in dire need.",Drones,2021-01-01,10.3390/DRONES5010013

A multi-agents system for solving facility layout problem: Application to operating theater,"Facility layout problem (FLP) has a great impact on the efficiency of any organization. It is concerned with defining the optimal location for each facility in order to optimize the supply chain productivity. In this kind of problems, the choice of resolution approach depends on the complexity and the size of the problem. Operating theaters are generally big structures containing a lot of facilities, which makes the conception of their layout a complex problem. In the literature, exact methods are powerless when faced with problem sizes up to 18 facilities. This leads us to explore other approaches, looking for efficient solutions. This paper presents a novel approach using a multi-agents system where agents' skills are exploited to cover a wide research space, to accelerate the decision-making process and to deal with real-life problem sizes. This decision-making tool is based on several mixed integer linear programming models for solving the FLP, and considers two types of environments with deterministic and variant patient demand. Several experiments have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and several problem instances with >80 facilities have been solved in reasonable time.",Journal of Intelligent Systems,2021-01-01,10.1515/jisys-2017-0081
Digital innovation and the future of work,"The concept of digitalization captures the widespread adoption of digital technologies in our lives, in the structure and functioning of organizations and in the transformation of our economy and society. Digital technologies for data processing and communication underly high-impact innovations including the Internet of Things, wireless multimedia, artificial intelligence, big data, enterprise platforms, social networks and blockchain. These digital innovations not only bring new opportunities for prosperity and wellbeing but also affect our behaviors, activities, and daily lives. They enable and shape new forms of production and new working practices in sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, logistics and supply chains, energy, and public and business services. Digital innovations are not purely technological but form part of comprehensive systemic innovations of a sociotechnical and networked nature, requiring the alignment of technology, processes, organizations, and humans. Examples are platform-based work, customer driven value creating networks, and urban public service systems. Building on widespread networking, algorithmic decisions and sharing of personal data, these innovations raise intensive societal and ethical debates regarding key issues such as data sovereignty and privacy intrusion, business models based on data surveillance and negative externalization, quality of work and jobs, and market dominance versus regulation. In this context, this book focuses on the implications of digitalization for the domain of work.

A healthcare logistic network considering stochastic emission of contamination: Bi-objective model and solution algorithm,"This paper presents a novel healthcare waste location-routing problem by concentrating on a new perspective in healthcare logistics networks. In this problem, there are healthcare, treatment, and disposal centers. Locations of healthcare centers are known, however, it is required to select appropriate locations for treatment, recycling, and disposal centers. Healthcare wastes are divided into infectious and non-infectious wastes. Since a great volume of healthcare wastes are infectious, the emission of contamination can have obnoxious impacts on the environment. The proposed problem considers a stochastic essence for the emission of contamination which depends on the transferring times. In this respect, transferring times between healthcare and treatment centers have been considered as normal random variables. As transferring time increases, it is more likely for the contamination to spread. Having visited a treatment center, infectious wastes are sterilized and they will no longer be harmful to the environment. This research develops a bi-objective mixed-integer mathematical formulation to tackle this problem. The objectives of this model are minimization of total costs and emission of contamination, simultaneously. Complexity of the proposed problem led the researchers to another contribution. This study also develops a Multi-Objective Water-Flow like Algorithm (MOWFA), which is a meta-heuristic, to solve the problem. This algorithm uses a procedure based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to rank the non-dominated solutions in the archive set. By means of a developed mating operator, the MOWFA utilizes the best ranked solutions of the archive in order to obtain high quality offspring. Two neighborhood operators have been designed for the MOWFA as the local search methods. Extensive computational experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the MOWFA on several test problems compared with other meta-heuristics, namely the Multi-Objective Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (MOICA) and Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA). These experiments also include a real healthcare waste logistic network in Iran. The computational experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm prevails these algorithms in terms of some well-known performance evaluation measures.",Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,2020-10-01,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102060
Support of the logistics chain by small aircraft in times of emergency,"Healthcare logistics, which is primarily aimed at patient care, represents a number of activities in the area of supply chain management. Hospitals are a key link in the supply chain, where they are the end customer, the supply chain from the manufacturer through all bottlenecks. A complete description of the distribution of medical supplies can be summarized into an external and internal supply chain. The external circuit represents the supply of the necessary commodities and ends at the distribution point. The internal circuit continues to the nursing units of the hospital supply chain. Currently, two basic forms are used for the distribution of supplies to the level of nursing units, through the regions, or through the supply from the humanitarian warehouse. The acquisition, storage, and distribution processes depend on the material availability on the market and the level of the maintained stocks. Modern technologies enable continuous collection of requirements and are the basis of a proactive approach to the solution, which allows the use of all accessible air transport, military and civilian capabilities, according to the criteria of the user or end customer.","NTinAD 2020 - New Trends in Aviation Development 2020 - 15th International Scientific Conference, Proceedings",2020-09-17,10.1109/NTAD51447.2020.9379077
Insights before flights: How community perceptions can make or break medical drone deliveries,"Drones are increasingly used to transport health products, but life-saving interventions can be stalled if local community concerns and preferences are not assessed and addressed. In order to inform the introduction of drones in new contexts, this paper analyzed similarities and differences in community perceptions of medical delivery drones in Malawi, Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Dominican Republic (DR). Community perceptions were assessed using focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) conducted with stakeholders at the national level, at health facilities and in communities. Data were collected on respondents’ familiarity with drones, perceptions of benefits and risks of drones, advice on drone operations and recommendations on sharing information with the community. The comparative analysis found similar perceptions around the potential benefits of using drones, as well as important differences in the perceived risks of flying drones and culturally appropriate communication mechanisms based on the local context. Because community perceptions are heavily influenced by culture and local experiences, a similar assessment should be conducted before introducing drone activities in new areas and two-way feedback channels should be established once drone operations are established in an area. The extent to which a community understands and supports the use of drones to transport health products will ultimately play a critical role in the success or failure of the drone’s ability to bring life-saving products to those who need them.",Drones,2020-09-01,10.3390/drones4030051

ONLINE CAPACITY PLANNING for REHABILITATION TREATMENTS: AN APPROXIMATE DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING APPROACH,"We study an online capacity planning problem in which arriving patients require a series of appointments at several departments, within a certain access time target. This research is motivated by a study of rehabilitation planning practices at the Sint Maartenskliniek hospital (the Netherlands). In practice, the prescribed treatments and activities are typically booked starting in the first available week, leaving no space for urgent patients who require a series of appointments at a short notice. This leads to the rescheduling of appointments or long access times for urgent patients, which has a negative effect on the quality of care and on patient satisfaction. We propose an approach for allocating capacity to patients at the moment of their arrival, in such a way that the total number of requests booked within their corresponding access time targets is maximized. The model considers online decision making regarding multi-priority, multi-appointment, and multi-resource capacity allocation. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that takes into account the current patient schedule, and future arrivals. We develop an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to obtain approximate optimal capacity allocation policies. We provide insights into the characteristics of the optimal policies and evaluate the performance of the resulting policies using simulation.",Probability in the Engineering and Informational Sciences,2020-07-01,10.1017/S0269964818000402
Simulation optimization for the inventory management of healthcare supplies,"This article covers the inventory management of healthcare supplies problem. Based on the mathematical programming model set out by [1], a causal model and a flow chart were developed to outline the simulation model, which was to be later applied to a highly specialized medical institution that performs high-risk heart surgery, such as catheterizations and angioplasties. With this simulation model, a purchases plan with 21 healthcare supplies was obtained that contemplates all the problem’s restrictions: purchasing policy (safety stock, available budget); the warehouse’s physical reality (warehouse capacity); characteristics of supplies (useful life, service level); and suppliers (price, capacity and size of lots or rounding value). Different indicators were also considered, such as service levels, costs of purchases, stockouts costs and inventory maintenance costs. The results obtained with the simulation model came very close to the mathematical programming results, but the computing times were considerably shorter.",International Journal of Simulation Modelling,2020-06-01,10.2507/IJSIMM19-2-514
Influenza vaccine uptake among older adults in Brazil: Socioeconomic equality and the role of preventive policies and public services,"Background: Influenza is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Since 1999, influenza vaccine is provided free-of-charge to adults aged 60 years or more in Brazil. Although vaccination coverage is high, previous studies have shown that socioeconomic and lifestyle factors play an essential role in predicting vaccine uptake. This study aimed to investigate whether previous knowledge of factors that constrain influenza vaccine uptake among older adults contributed to increasing the access to vaccination in 2015–16. Methods: This cross-sectional study assessed data from the baseline of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging. This national representative sample encompassed individuals aged 60 and older (n = 5221). Vaccination status was the outcome variable; covariates included socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics, health status, and access to healthcare. Logistic regression fitted the association between vaccine uptake and covariates. Results: The coverage of influenza vaccination was 73.0% (95% confidence interval: 70.6–75.2); ranking lower than the goal of 80% set up by the national health authority. The most frequent reasons to justify the option of skipping vaccination were cultural beliefs about the lack of efficacy and possible side effects of the vaccine. The coverage of vaccination did not differ by socioeconomic characteristics. Older individuals, never smokers, having two or more chronic diseases, and being registered in the Family Health Program were positively associated with influenza vaccine uptake. Conclusions: Absent socioeconomic inequalities point out changes in the barriers to vaccination. These findings provide insights into tailoring public health strategies, targeting professional recommendations and public perceptions of the vaccine.",Journal of Infection and Public Health,2020-02-01,10.1016/j.jiph.2019.07.022
How to use lean manufacturing for improving a Healthcare logistics performance,"Most companies in the world are focused on their global performance for being competitive on the market. Lean manufacturing is one of the main methodologies used by them for increasing their supply chain and logistics performance. Indeed, Logistics performance improvement implies the definition of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for measuring at each transformation level, the evolution of the logistics system. Thus, Industry 4.0 and logistics 4.0 concepts are defined for implementing new technologies, tools and organizations in companies in order to define their future. A new framework, based on lean manufacturing and DMAIC methodologies, with sustainability as its kernel has been developed in Icam, A Higher education school, for SMEs. In addition, European population is growing older day by day and they are regularly visiting hospitals. In this context, the treatment of patients in good conditions (quality, cost and lead time) is necessary as much as the hospital global performance. In this frame, a project is ongoing between FEI, a Brazilian University and Icam for defining and implementing Healthcare Logistics 4.0 (including lean manufacturing).

Healthcare logistics &amp; supply chain management in health industry of Indonesia based on the telemedicine,"The essential mission of logistics and supply chain management is to efficiently plan, organize, and coordinate the movement of goods from a point of origin to a point of consumption. Analyzing and aligning supply chain goals with a patient-first approach enables healthcare organizations to reduce costs while improving patient outcomes. With Patient Direct, a care delivery solution from HRS, this paper provides patients with the telehealth equipment they need when they need it by telemedicine. Telemedicine which is used interchangeably with the term telehealth is the remote delivery of healthcare to patients through information and communication technology, including communication between two or more health professionals who are not in the same location. Thus, it needs secure transmission of medical data through text, sound, image, or video. This system can be a tele-education, tele-monitoring, tele-consultation, or tele-intervention. Telemedicine has several benefits, both for health professionals and medical institution as well as for the patients, especially for the development of healthcare delivery in remote area and also to make interaction between healthcare professional faster. However, telemedicine still has lack of regulation in Indonesia. There is still no regulation about license for the health professional and safety of medical data. Ethical problems in telemedicine are also still an issue, especially about patient's confidentiality, and also it can weaken doctor-patients relationship. According code of ethics, a doctor must examine the patients first before making a diagnosis and treatment, which cannot be done with telemedicine. The lack of regulation and ethical consideration make telemedicine in Indonesia still has some problems and need a challenge for improvement.",International Journal of Supply Chain Management,2020-01-01,
Evaluating Replenishment Systems for Disposable Supplies at the Operating Theater: A Simulation Case Study,"Ensuring cost containment while providing high quality patient care is of paramount concern to hospitals. The operating theater in particular is a major cost driver for any hospital, and is among the most critical resources in terms of both capacity and patient care. Effective inventory and distribution systems are a prerequisite for realizing efficiency improvements in the internal operating theater supply chain. In this work, discrete-event simulation is used to model part of the internal distribution process in the operating theater at a Belgian Hospital and to identify improvements by focusing on the replenishment process. A logistics performance measurement framework based on Analytic Network Process (ANP), as a popular Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique, is adopted to assess three replenishment scenarios. The best performing scenario is selected using the Internal Logistics Efficiency Performance (ILEP) index as an evaluation basis. This research indicates that industrial engineering techniques, such as simulation and MCDM, which are successfully applied in industrial sectors, can also be adopted to realize efficiency opportunities in healthcare logistics.",Springer Proceedings in Mathematics and Statistics,2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-39694-7_12
Performance indicator selection for operating room supply chains: An application of ANP,"Manufacturing and maintenance processes significantly benefit from effective and integrated Supply Chain Management (SCM). Recently, hospitals start to recognize the importance of these logistics initiatives to improve their operational performance while also maintaining high quality of patient care. Patient care processes are supported by a range of supply chain activities including inventory management and distribution of medical supplies to point-of-care locations. At the operating room for instance, the logistics staff's goal is managing materials and information flows to have the requested materials at the right operating room at the right time, in the most efficient way. However, poor inventory management, lack of standardization and lack of coordination between departments complicate healthcare logistics processes, and hence result in many waste. Opportunities for efficiency gains in these logistics processes can be identified by measuring the performance of the internal supply chain. This paper presents a rigorously defined logistics performance measurement framework to evaluate the efficiency of logistics processes in operating rooms. The Analytic Network Process (ANP) is utilized as a popular Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique to provide effective decision-support models. The proposed ANP-based framework is a first step towards measuring the performance of operating room supply chain processes by selecting and prioritizing logistics objectives and associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Further research is required to validate the ANP framework by including multiple stakeholders’ preferences, as they may have conflicting views on performance definitions. The final goal of the framework is to support hospital logistics managers in making transparent and informed decisions to improve inventory and distribution policies in the operating room while considering all stakeholders’ preferences.",Operations Research for Health Care,2019-12-01,10.1016/j.orhc.2019.100229
Sustainable supply chain management practices and sustainable performance in hospitals: A systematic review and integrative framework,"Hospital supply chains are responsible for several economic inefficiencies, negative environmental impacts, and social concerns. However, a lack of research on sustainable supply chain management specific to this sector is identified. Existing studies do not analyze supply chain management practices in an integrated and detailed manner, and do not consider all sustainable performance dimensions. To address these gaps, this paper presents a systematic literature review and develops a framework for identifying the supply chain management practices that may contribute to sustainable performance in hospitals. The proposed framework is composed of 12 categories of management practices, which include strategic management and leadership, supplier management, purchasing, warehousing and inventory, transportation and distribution, information and technology, energy, water, food, hospital design, waste, and customer relationship management. On the other side, performance categories include economic, environmental, and social factors. Moreover, illustrative effects of practices on performance are discussed. The novelty of this document lies in its focus on hospital settings, as well as on its comprehensiveness regarding the operationalization of practices and performance dimensions.

Towards Semantic Sensitive Feature Profiling of IoT Devices,"Billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices are being adopted in our daily life as personal wearables, home automation agents, medical appliances, etc. Many domains of their use nowadays rely on the privacy and security of these devices - critical infrastructure, healthcare, logistics, manufacturing. In this paper, we aim to establish a standardized framework, which does not require access to physical devices yet allows to profile security and privacy-sensitive functionality in both existing and upcoming IoT products, based on semantic analysis of discovered technical information. We develop a software tool for automatic feature profiling of IoT devices and present case studies on two real-world IoT devices - a fitness tracker, Garmin Forerunner 230, and a voice-controlled home assistant, Amazon Echo Dot second generation and further provide comparative results analysis.",IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019-10-01,10.1109/JIOT.2019.2903739
An evaluation of the delivery of medicines using drones,"This study tests the impact of drone transportation on the quality of a medicine. Modelling the critical process parameters of drone flight, the effects of temperature and vibration on insulin were investigated using the pharmacopoeia methods. The medicine, Actrapid, (3.5 mg/mL of insulin), was flown by a quad-rotor drone. Insulin stored between −20 and 40◦C for 30 mins, and subjected to vibration (0–40 Hz, 25◦C, 30 mins) passed the pharmacopeia tests. Dynamic light scattering identified the active tetrameric and hexameric forms of insulin post testing. Vibration frequencies during drone flight were between 0.1 and 3.4 Hz. There was no evidence of visible insulin aggregates following the drone transportation. The differences in UV absorbance readings between flown Actrapid and controls were insignificant (p = 0.89). No adverse impact of drone transport on insulin was observed. This study provides supporting evidence that drone transportation of medicinal products containing insulin is feasible. The authors recommend that when considering the drone delivery of medicines five tests need to be applied. These tests must determine the safe flight time and range, the quality of the medicine post flight, the onboard conditions experienced by the medicine, the security of the drone supply chain and the effect of drone failure on both the medicine and the environment.",Drones,2019-09-01,10.3390/drones3030052
A novel group ownership transfer protocol for RFID systems,"Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a wireless communication technology nowadays widely used in almost every aspect of our lives including healthcare, logistics and supply chain management, inventory tracking, race timing, access control, toll collection, and a lot more. In RFID systems, a tag usually stores private or sensitive information, and so it needs an access control mechanism. When a tag's owner is changed, the read permission of the tag needs to be transferred from the old owner to the new owner, and this is when ownership transfer schemes come into play. In fact, not only do RFID ownership transfer schemes do ownership transfer, but they have to make sure that the ownership transfer procedure is executed under proper security protection. Besides, in some particular environments, the ownership transfer would be far more efficiently done if the tags could be treated as a group instead of individual tags. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel group ownership transfer protocol that satisfies all important security requirements including mutual authentication, data and location privacy, forward/backward secrecy, ownership privacy, and group ownership integrity. In addition, due to the use of cloud computing, our new protocol provides ubiquitous authentication. Based on homomorphic encryption and quadratic residues, our novel RFID group ownership transfer protocol can have encrypted data efficiently processed, and the communication cost is very low. The results of our BAN logic correctness check, security analysis, and performance evaluation confirm that the new protocol is logically correct and is capable of providing high level security/privacy protection on the basis of high cost-effective performance.",Ad Hoc Networks,2019-08-01,10.1016/j.adhoc.2019.101873

Using lean manufacturing and machine learning for improving medicines procurement and dispatching in a hospital,"Industry 4.0 concepts are defined around the use of new technologies for improving industrial companies according to scientific, technological and organizational aspects. Enterprise complex problems could be solved in this frame. Many methods and concepts presented in the literature are focused on these aspects. A new method is being developed in Icam Paris-Sénart around the idea that sustainability must be the kernel of “industry of the future”. Indeed, the framework proposed is a combination of the previous aspects with environmental, social and societal aspects. The actual situation of the planet is an encouragement to make all future transformations with sustainability as kernel. These concepts could be imported in healthcare logistics and transport area for solving specific problems of this domain. Icam (French Engineer school) and FEI University are collaborating for proposing to healthcare hospitals a new framework (healthcare logistics 4.0) for solving complex problems of this domain. This paper is focusing on how to improve medicines procurement and dispatching in a hospital. Indeed, the use of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare sector is growing up. Data treated and analyzed could give important insights for solving problems and improving the existing organization. As machine learning is already exploited in many production management problems (forecasting, storage, production, etc.), the idea is to use it for developing an aided tool in addition to a lean manufacturing classical approach. After presenting the real problem of medicines procurement and dispatching detected in healthcare hospitals, concepts of lean manufacturing and machine learning will be exposed. Then, the methodology proposed for solving the problem will be shown. An illustration will be given for validating concepts presented. Finally, the link with the global “Healthcare logistics 4.0” framework will be described.",Procedia Manufacturing,2019-01-01,10.1016/j.promfg.2020.01.189

Develop the healthcare logistics service with kano model,"With the advancement of information and communication technologies in the healthcare industry and the strong growth in the sales of temperature sensitive healthcare products, the demand for cold chain logistics service has increased greatly in recent years. Therefore, developing an effective logistics service model for cold chain logistics is essential to help enterprises improve logistics quality and reduce cost. This study aims at applying the five dimensions of service quality (SERVQUAL) model to construct the service elements that customers are concerned about, and then applied the Kano model to categorize the service elements. For analyzing customers’ needs, primary data were collected from a survey administered to respondents who have used a logistics service for healthcare products. Through the convenient sampling, a total of 101 effective paper-based survey questionnaires were received for analysis. From the classification results, 2 service elements are classified as attractive elements, 8 service elements are classified as must-be elements, 15 services elements are classified as one-dimensional elements, 1 service elements is classified as an indifferent element, and no service elements are classified as reverse element in this study. Specifically, this study identified the service elements that need to be modified in the future pursuit of a more innovative service model, to develop a new cold chain logistics service for healthcare that better satisfies customers and creates and maintains a competitive advantage. Practitioners and researchers in the field of cold chain logistics may refer to this study’s findings of customers’ needs and classified service elements with the Kano model to assist in developing new logistics service model.",Journal of Quality,2019-01-01,10.6220/joq.201902_26(1).0001
Measuring the logistics performance of internal hospital supply chains – A literature study,"The patient care processes in hospitals are supported by a range of operational activities including inventory management and distribution of supplies to point-of-care locations. Hospitals carry large amounts and a great variety of items, and the issues of storing and distributing these items throughout the hospital supply chain are of great importance to providing high-quality patient service. Healthcare logistics encompasses the process of handling physical goods (e.g. pharmaceuticals, surgical medical products, medical equipment, sterile items, linen, food, etc.) and the associated information flows, from the reception of the goods within a hospital to their delivery at patient care locations. The medical supply costs constitute the second largest expenditure in hospitals, after personnel costs. A high-performing supply chain may realize improved outcomes (e.g. safe and quality patient service) and greater efficiency. Logistics managers need to identify opportunities to improve the logistics processes in order to lower costs and to improve patient care quality. However, in order to improve the logistics processes, you must understand how the healthcare supply chain is currently performing. Measuring the performance of the supply chain is fundamental to identify and address deficiencies in the logistics activities, and it serves as a good input for managerial decision-making. The purpose of this article is to present existing research on performance measurement at the internal hospital supply chain (e.g. inventory management, distribution activities), and more specifically in the operating theatre since it is among the most critical resources for a hospital. At the operating theatre, the requested items should be available at the right time at the right place, in the right condition, at the lowest cost possible. Furthermore, we will also discuss literature on multi-criteria decision-making techniques. It enables researchers to build a performance measurement framework and to prioritize between multiple performance indicators since a diverse group of stakeholders with conflicting interests is involved in the internal operating room supply chain.",Omega (United Kingdom),2019-01-01,10.1016/j.omega.2018.01.007
A systematic literature review of simulation models for non-technical skill training in healthcare logistics,"Background: Resource allocation in patient care relies heavily on individual judgements of healthcare professionals. Such professionals perform coordinating functions by managing the timing and execution of a multitude of care processes for multiple patients. Based on advances in simulation, new technologies that could be used for establishing realistic representations have been developed. These simulations can be used to facilitate understanding of various situations, coordination training and education in logistics, decision-making processes, and design aspects of the healthcare system. However, no study in the literature has synthesized the types of simulations models available for non-technical skills training and coordination of care. Methods: A systematic literature review, following the PRISMA guidelines, was performed to identify simulation models that could be used for training individuals in operative logistical coordination that occurs on a daily basis. This article reviewed papers of simulation in healthcare logistics presented in the Web of Science Core Collections, ACM digital library, and JSTOR databases. We conducted a screening process to gather relevant papers as the knowledge foundation of our literature study. The screening process involved a query-based identification of papers and an assessment of relevance and quality. Results: Two hundred ninety-four papers met the inclusion criteria. The review showed that different types of simulation models can be used for constructing scenarios for addressing different types of problems, primarily for training and education sessions. The papers identified were classified according to their utilized paradigm and focus areas. (1) Discrete-event simulation in single-category and single-unit scenarios formed the most dominant approach to developing healthcare simulations and dominated all other categories by a large margin. (2) As we approached a systems perspective (cross-departmental and cross-institutional), discrete-event simulation became less popular and is complemented by system dynamics or hybrid modeling. (3) Agent-based simulations and participatory simulations have increased in absolute terms, but the share of these modeling techniques among all simulations in this field remains low. Conclusions: An extensive study analyzing the literature on simulation in healthcare logistics indicates a growth in the number of examples demonstrating how simulation can be used in healthcare settings. Results show that the majority of studies create situations in which non-technical skills of managers, coordinators, and decision makers can be trained. However, more system-level and complex system-based approaches are limited and use methods other than discrete-event simulation.",Advances in Simulation,2018-12-01,10.1186/s41077-018-0072-7
L'impartition des activités logistiques dans le secteur de la santé: les leçons d'une expérience canadienne,"Logistics activities are seen by many healthcare organizations as an opportunity for financial savings. The level of logistics complexity in these organizations may explain the challenges they face in applying solutions common in other industries.

Logistics practices in healthcare organizations in Bogota,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the current state of logistics practices in healthcare organizations in Bogota, Colombia. Design/methodology/approach: The assessment is based on case study research using open interviews, focused interviews, a questionnaire and direct observations as sources of evidence. Seven Colombian health care settings are analyzed: four public hospitals and three private clinics. Cross-case analysis allows the identification of patterns regarding supply management, inventory management, replenishment and use of information and communication technologies. Findings: Manual procedures, poor planning, little recognition from top management and a lack of specialized personnel characterize the current situation. Innovative practices with a potential to improve the efficacy of logistics activities are rare, particularly in public hospitals. Research avenues: Future research could replicate this study in other Colombian cities, in order to generalize the results to the whole country. It could also be interesting to document successful and less successful implementations of innovative logistics practices in Colombian hospitals to guide and promote their adoption. Research limitations/implications: The small number of cases considered, and the fact that the research is concentrated in one city, limits the generalizability of the results. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is the first to explore the state of healthcare logistics practices in Colombia.",Academia Revista Latinoamericana de Administracion,2018-11-30,10.1108/ARLA-08-2016-0219
Hospital Capacity Planning for Special Economic Zone in Thailand: A Case Study in Kanchanaburi Province,"Increasing the employment demand in a particular region has an impact on the healthcare system due to types of occupational diseases/injuries and number of workers. Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand, is one of target areas to launch special economic zone (SEZ), which will cause dramatic population growth. Thus the aim of this research is to propose hospital capacity planning in Kanchanaburi taking into account the upcoming SEZ. This study employs a two-stage approach for data collection and validation. Firstly, interview and focus group is used to gather all related healthcare logistic issues. Then hospital's capacity is forecasted based on target health provider-topopulation ratios.

Multicommodity flows and Benders decomposition for restricted continuous location problems,"The restricted continuous facility location problem arises when there is a need to locate a number of facilities to serve a discrete set of demand points, and where the location of a facility can be anywhere on the plane except for in restricted regions. The problem finds applications in urban planning, disaster management, and healthcare logistics. The restricted regions can occur randomly or are known in advance. The paper describes a new model for the problem that is based on multicommodity flows with unknown destinations and defined on a discretization of the plane. The model and discretization are applied to both the deterministic and the stochastic continuous restricted location problem, where the latter is converted into a deterministic equivalent problem by minimizing the expected value of the objective function weighted by the probabilities of scenarios. The paper also describes a Benders decomposition algorithm to optimally solve the model. Extensive computational results are presented on both benchmark instances from the literature and new instances, on both the deterministic and stochastic variant of the problem. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is superior to an off-the-shelf solver in terms of computational time. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the exact algorithm described here is the first to address both the deterministic and the stochastic variants of continuous restricted location problems with any number of facilities.",European Journal of Operational Research,2018-05-01,10.1016/j.ejor.2017.11.033
Develop a strategy for improving healthcare logistics performance,"Recently, there has been a great interest in applying logistics and supply chain management practice and strategy in healthcare services. This paper proposes a strategy for improving healthcare logistics performance. Eighteen hospitals located in different countries, namely Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, and Thailand, were interviewed about their national and operational performance. The tool for assessing national healthcare performance, that is, the Health Metric Network framework, developed by the World Health Organization in 2008 was applied to assess the healthcare logistics infrastructure of those countries. Furthermore, we developed set of logistics performance indicators at the operational level. The Analytical Network Process methodology was used to develop the hierarchical measurement for those operational healthcare logistics performances. The results show interdependencies between operational and national performance. The operational performance is affected by the country’s environment. Finally, a strategy for improving healthcare logistics performance is proposed. The interdependences between operational and national performance are discussed.",Supply Chain Forum,2018-01-01,10.1080/16258312.2017.1416876

Outsourcing strategies and distribution models in Italian Pharma Supply Chain,"In the pharmaceutical supply chain, all players have to ensure the highest level of service while containing costs, because of the ethical issues concerning drugs. The outsourcing of logistics should be recognized as a competitive lever, especially in this complex and highly regulated industry. Based on these premises, the research objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between the outsourcing strategies of manufacturers and the logistics services offered by Third-Party Logistics Service providers (3PLs). To achieve this objective, a multiple case study was designed to analyse the different physical distribution models adopted by pharmaceutical companies. We collected qualitative data and the subjective perceptions of several logistics directors, conducting structured interviews with 11 pharmaceutical companies and six 3PLs. We have identified three physical distribution models, on the basis of the number and location of the warehouses used (single warehouse, dual warehouse and multi-warehouse models). We discovered that there is a strict relationship between the physical distribution model adopted by pharmaceutical companies and their features (i.e. the main distribution channel, product portfolio, target service level, transport and warehousing costs and other company related issues). Our research also offers an empirical insight into the key logistic services that 3PLs should offer within the pharma industry. In conclusion, the study draws a roadmap to guide pharmaceutical companies in their strategic logistics decisions in Italy, while also considering possible future trends deriving from changes to European regulations.","Proceedings - 2017 IEEE International Conference on Service Operations and Logistics, and Informatics, SOLI 2017",2017-11-27,10.1109/SOLI.2017.8120990
A Roadmap Towards Healthcare Logistics in Thailand,"Apart from operation dimension in supply chain, another perspective in healthcare supply chain is the infrastructure for Logistics. This infrastructure concerns much in data and information flows.

Strategy deployment in healthcare services: A case study approach,"For a number of years, multiple studies have suggested that the effective management of logistics can generate significant gains for healthcare institutions. Yet, the studies also show that despite widespread knowledge of best practices, most institutions struggle to deploy practices that can enhance the logistics performance of their organization. In fact, healthcare institution managers are lacking guidelines enabling them to deploy a logistics strategy supporting the implementation of such practices. Using longitudinal case studies of two Canadian hospitals that made significant improvements in this regard, we will analyze the deployment strategy for exemplary materials management practices. In these studies, we will consider that two aspects are essential in deploying a logistics strategy in a service undertaking. First, there must be well-defined strategic intent. Based on this, the organization must implement an experimental series of logistics practices. This implementation process offers two benefits: 1) it should enable innovative practices to be tested, and 2) it should provide the organization with the time to absorb these innovations, particularly given the complex environment within a hospital.",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2016-12-01,10.1016/j.techfore.2016.09.006
Energy efficient approach to send data in cognitive radio wireless sensor networks(CRSN),"The adoption of cognitive radio wireless sensor networks be supposed to preserve developing, essentially in such a fields as a healthcare, logistic, scientific and a military applications. Yet, a sensor size or dimension represents a consequential constraint mainly in expressions of an energy autonomy and as a result of a life period for the batteries which is so too tiny. Thus, the reason why a concentrated research being conducted at the present time on how to control energy consumption in sensor within a network, taking communications into account as a precedence. For this intention, we propose a algorithm or method to send data from source to sink with a less energy consumption within cognitive wireless sensor networks, according to the number of nodes, data flow rate, and the distance between them. Moreover, we have succeeded in sinking energy utilization within a linear sensor network through up with nodes featuring with differing data flow rates between them.","2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics, ICACCI 2016",2016-11-02,10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732352

A way for reducing drug supply chain cost for a hospital district: A case study,"Purpose: This work aims at providing insights to optimise healthcare logistic of the drug management, in order to deal with the healthcare expenditure cut. In this paper the effects of different drug supply chain configurations, on the resulting average stock, service level and Bullwhip effect, of the studied supply chain, is quantitatively assessed. Design/methodology/approach: A case study of an Italian district has been studied, taking into account three echelons: suppliers, central stock, and hospitals. A model of the various supply chain configurations has been created with the use of the simulation. Specifically, 24 supply chain configurations have been examined, stemming from the combination of several supply chain design parameters, namely: transshipment policies (Emergency Lateral Transshipment or Total Inventory Equalization); re-order and inventory management policies (Economic Order Quantity or Economic Order Interval); required service levels (90% or 95%); the number of available vans (one or two). For each configuration, hospital average stock, service level and a “Bullwhip effect” analysis are computed. To know which input variables are statistically significant, a DoE (Design of Experiments) analysis has been executed. Findings: The output of this paper provides useful insights and suggestions to optimize the healthcare logistic and drug supply chain. According to the developed DoE analysis, it can be stated that the introduction of transshipment policies provides important improvement in terms of service and stock levels. To reduce the Bullwhip effect, which results in a service level decreasing, and in a managing stock costs increasing, it is worth to adopt an EOQ re-order policy. Practical implications: This research gives practical recommendations to the studied system, in order to reduce costs and maintain a very satisfactory service level. Originality/value: This paper fulfils an identified need to study which combination of transshipment policies, re-order/inventory management policies and required service levels, can be the best one to reduce costs and maintain a very satisfactory service level, in the specific logistic system.",Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management,2016-01-01,10.3926/jiem.1262

Healthcare logistic network models for shared resource management,"In this work, we propose a simulation-based optimization approach that addresses the problem of the design of collaborative healthcare logistic networks through the re-thinking of the inventory management process and the resources sharing rules. We especially analyze the gains from medical supplies pooling within a group of nearby hospitals through the instrumentation of the inventory centralization scheme and the rules for lateral inventory sharing such as the emergency lateral transshipment.",Proceedings - CIE 45: 2015 International Conference on Computers and Industrial Engineering,2015-01-01,
Measuring process performance within healthcare logistics - a decision tool for selecting track and trace technologies,"Monitoring tasks and ascertaining quality of work is difficult in a logistical healthcare process due to cleaning personnel being dispersed throughout the hospital. Performance measurement can support the organization in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of processes and in ensuring quality of work. Data validity is essential for enabling performance measurement, and selecting the right technologies is important to achieve this. A case study of the hospital cleaning process was conducted at a public Danish hospital to develop a framework for assessing technologies in healthcare logistics. A set of decision indicators was identified in the case study to assess technologies based on expected process performance. Two aspects of performance measurement were investigated for the hospital cleaning process: what to measure and how to measure it.",Academy of Strategic Management Journal,2015-01-01,
Critical-to-life classification for managing inventory in a healthcare supply chain,"This paper presents a multi-criterion critical-to-life classification technique to supplement the cost and usage measures that are normally employed in hospital inventory management. A system dynamics model was developed employing (R, s, S) inventory control approach for a US private sector healthcare supply chain. Extensive simulation analyses were conducted to study the stock behaviour for low, medium and high usage critical-to-life items to maintain a range of service levels. The (R, s, S) design parameters were optimised according to the variability of item usage, the associated inventory level and supply lead-time. Our findings suggest that the proposed inventory classification technique allows for assigning a particular service level to each critical-to-life item to ensure its availability while minimising the cost and stock-out situations. The proposed simulation tool incorporating critical-to-life inventory classification facilitates hospital logistics managers to devise efficient inventory control strategies based on critical-to-life service level index.",International Journal of Intelligent Enterprise,2015-01-01,10.1504/IJIE.2015.073491
A hierarchical decomposition framework for modeling combinatorial optimization problems,"Complex Optimization Problems has existed in many fields of science, including economics, healthcare, logistics and finance where a complex problem has to be solved. Thus, modeling a complex problem is a fundamental step to relax its complexity and achieve to a final solution of the master problem. Hierarchical optimization is a main step in optimization problems handling process. It consists of decomposing an optimization problem into two or more sub-problems; each sub-problem has its own objectives and constraints. It will help to prove the correct understanding and represent the problem in a different form that facilitates its solving. In this work, we stipulate that a hierarchical decomposition of complex problems can yield to more effective solutions. The proposed framework will contain four possible strategies which will be detailed through this paper; objective based decomposition; constraints based decomposition, semantic decomposition and data partitioning strategy. Each strategy will be argued by a set of examples from the literature to validate our framework. However, some conditions shall be verified to model the problem using such conditions are problems' characteristics that will help to identify if a combinatorial optimization problem can be modeled within the proposed framework and they are detailed in the following subsections.",Procedia Computer Science,2015-01-01,10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.169
Towards an it-based coordination platform for the german emergency medical service system,"The German healthcare service system is facing a number of challenges in the years to come, prominent among these a decreasing number of hospitals and practices dealing with an increasing number of treatments and patient transportation tasks. In this paper, we introduce the idea of building a decision support tool to improve scheduling of patient transportation in the German Emergency Medical Service (EMS) system to reduce waiting times and costs, as well as increasing reliability. We outline a service platform on which the decision support tool could be realized and integrated with existing systems in EMS coordination centers.

Optimization of tag anti-collision algorithm for EPC Gen2 RFID,"The proliferation of the RFID (Radio-Frequency IDentification) technology in the last decade shows its importance as effective solution for a large variety of application scenarios, such as monitoring, homeland security, healthcare, logistic and last but not the least Internet of Things. Actually, an accurate RFID modeling, optimization and performance analysis via simulation is strongly desired. In this paper, the authors propose two innovations of tag anti-collision algorithm in EPC Gen 2 RFID Specification: i. the adaptive management of Q-parameter (to maximize the efficiency of the inventory procedure depending on the tags number) and its communication by a QueryAdjust command, and ii. the muting option, which silences the tags after their identification with the effect of reducing the offered load to the reader after each successful identification.","2014 Euro Med Telco Conference - From Network Infrastructures to Network Fabric: Revolution at the Edges, EMTC 2014",2014-12-23,10.1109/EMTC.2014.6996631
Modelling the growing process of integrated healthcare supply networks,"This work contributes to the practice of healthcare system modelling, by presenting an urgent issue: the growing process of integrated healthcare supply networks in reducing public healthcare systems' annual expenses and improving performance. Various critical aspects affect the strategic design and development of healthcare logistic networks in practice. The conceptual discussion is empirically derived on the basis of the challenge created by the development of centralized healthcare supply networks supported by the implementation of new IT/IS investments and advanced logistic hubs for hospital material inventory management. The study moves towards the development of a newer ""Healthcare Supply Network Causal Loop Diagram,"" to analyse and predict the growth pattern of a healthcare logistic network in its complexity, and understand how well the supply network will fit with the benefit provided by new logistic economies of scale and the risk of failures under uncertainty.","Healthcare Administration: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications",2014-08-31,10.4018/978-1-4666-6339-8.ch019
Tailoring LTE-advanced for M2M communication using wireless inband relay node,"Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication is one of the newest research fields today and is expected to play a vital role in business areas such as e-healthcare, logistics etc. Mobile communication standards, such as Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) are designed to provide high data rate and broadband services to human-based communication. However, the nature of M2M traffic is different as terminals usually have to transmit small amounts of data infrequently. In this paper, we evaluate an LTE-A Relay Node (RN) based solution to integrate M2M devices into mobile cellular networks. We develop an M2M scenario consisting of both e-healthcare and logistic devices along with normal LTE-A users in our simulation model using OPNET modeler. The simulation results indicate the better performance of LTE-A network if RN is used for the multiplexing and aggregation of M2M data traffic.","Proceedings of World Telecommunications Congress 2014, WTC 2014",2014-01-01,
Automation in internal logistics: Strategic and operational challenges,"Automation in internal logistics is an enabler to increase overall competitiveness in an organisation. However, its use is currently limited. The main objective of this paper is to highlight the existing strategic and operational challenges to using and developing automation in internal logistics. A three-phased empirical study has been conducted, including case studies and a survey. The findings reveal a lack of responsibility for, and insight in current state of logistics operations as well as a lack of vision and strategy giving directions for desired future state of operations. In addition, the actual automation projects are hindered by poorly defined and supported processes. It is concluded that functional strategies for internal logistics and automation can give the support needed along with process models for automation projects. The content and application of these strategies and models are suggested.

Drug inventory management and distribution: outsourcing logistics to thirdparty providers,"The purpose of the present research is to explore the current situation and future expectations on whether to selfmanage or outsource logistics operations in centralized healthcare networks, and to analyse and quantify the relationships between logistics outsourcing, costs and performance. The paper is based on a thorough study of a local Italian healthcare network, which evaluated the economic sustainability of logistics outsourcing. The data were collected using interviews, documentation and observations in hospital pharmacies and wards, and by referring to public information available on the internet. A system dynamic simulation followed by a sensitivity analysis was used to investigate the impact of changing key variables as well as the advice of logistics providers. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that logistics outsourcing is often the most economical choice. Performanceoriented concepts applied to healthcare have many pros in terms of sustainable delivery of quality healthcare at affordable costs. While there are numerous studies on logistics outsourcing in many industries, when it comes to the healthcare sector literature is scarce, probably due to the great changes this sector has faced in recent times: thus, the paper's quantitative findings should be seen as a first attempt to assist the “makeorbuy” decision process toward sustainable development of the healthcare sector. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Strategic Outsourcing: An International Journal,2013-02-15,10.1108/17538291311316063
The business value of RFID,"RFID can be defined as a strategic technology tool redesigning business processes, cutting costs, and improving the operational performance. It is used for a wide variety of application areas ranging from retail to manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, and defense. It may improve the potential benefits of supply chain management through increase of the four factors: efficiency, accuracy, visibility, and security. Calculating the return on investments, the impact levels of RFID on these factors should be quantified accurately for each supply chain member.

Healthcare service modeling to minimize disruptions due to natural disasters,"The aftermath of any disaster could be enormous and annihilating especially for healthcare industry. In case of an emergency, the healthcare organizations in the affected region may experience out of stock situation for medical supplies which eventually impact their services. Healthcare providers need to replenish their supplies from central distribution centers or unaffected regional distribution centers. The most difficult situation that authorities face is the complexity of operating conditions where they had to work in order to supply medical items to the affected region from a central position. Some regions may be very difficult to reach under disaster condition. In this scenario it may be required to share medical items from contiguous health care organizations. Operations Research techniques have already been proven to be beneficial for different planning situations, mainly during the preparation and the response phase of disaster life cycle. There are very few works that have been done in the field of inventory relocation in case of a disaster. This paper discusses the modeling techniques to minimize the stock out situation of medical supplies in the natural disaster affected zones.",IIE Annual Conference and Expo 2013,2013-01-01,
Modelling hospital materials management processes,"Materials management is an important issue for healthcare systems because it influences clinical and financial outcomes. Before selecting, adapting and implementing leading or optimized practices, a good understanding of processes and activities has to be developed. In real applications, the information flows and business strategies involved are different from hospital to hospital, depending on context, culture and available resources; it is therefore difficult to find a comprehensive and exhaustive description of processes, even more so a clear formalization of them. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, it proposes an integrated and detailed analysis and description model for hospital materials management data and tasks, which is able to tackle information from patient requirements to usage, from replenishment requests to supplying and handling activities. The model takes account of medical risk reduction, traceability and streamlined processes perspectives. Second, the paper translates this information into a business process model and mathematical formalization.

Potential impact of RFID-based tracing systems on the integrity of pharmaceutical products,"Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is going to play a crucial role as auto-identification technology in a wide range of applications such as healthcare, logistics, supply chain management, ticketing, et cetera. The use of electromagnetic waves to identify, trace, and track people or goods allows solving many problems related to auto-identification devices based on optical reading (i.e. bar code). Currently, high interest is concentrated on the use of Radio Frequency (RF) solutions in healthcare and pharmaceutical supply chain, in order to improve drugs flow transparency and patients' safety. Unfortunately, there is a possibility that drug interaction with electromagnetic fields (EMFs) generated by RF devices, such as RFID readers, deteriorate the potency of bioactive compounds. This chapter proposes an experimental multidisciplinary approach to investigate potential alterations induced by EMFs on drug molecular structure and performance. To show the versatility of this approach, some experimental results obtained on two biological pharmaceuticals (peptide hormone-based) are discussed. © 2013, IGI Global.","Advanced RFID Systems, Security, and Applications",2012-12-01,10.4018/978-1-4666-2080-3.ch011
Progress towards data standards adoption in healthcare,"The contribution of this paper is to report on the progress of and barriers to adoption of data standards in healthcare logistics. This paper is directed to engineering managers with an interest in healthcare management, information management, and supply chain management. Data standards in healthcare logistics fall into two categories: product identification numbers and location identification numbers. Product identification numbers are assigned to any item that may be priced, ordered, or invoiced at any point in any supply chain, location identification numbers are used to identify physical locations to improve the efficiency of communication with the supply chain. The main objective of this paper is to convey the potential benefits of data standards adoption in the healthcare supply chain and present empirical evidence of progress toward adoption as well as a discussion of barriers toward adoption. Data is presented and analyzed from surveys conducted in 2008, 2010 and 2011. The results show encouraging progress being made towards data standards adoption; however, many barriers still exist. Engineering managers will appreciate the potential benefits of data standards adoption in healthcare logistics and will see the role engineers and engineering managers can have in facilitating data standards adoption and overcoming the barriers faced. Engineering managers will also see the opportunities for healthcare process improvement once data standards are adopted.

Mapping the supply chain of anti-malarial drugs in Sub-Saharan African countries,"With malaria emerging as one of the deadliest infectious diseases for young children and women in Sub-Saharan African countries, a growing number of healthcare organisations and government authorities have increased their relentless efforts to control malaria epidemics in Africa. One of the causes for malaria epidemics is the lack of accessibility to anti-malarial drugs that results from archaic logistics infrastructure, inefficient distribution channels and disruptive black markets in Africa. This paper identifies factors that either enhance or hinder the accessibility of anti-malarial drugs to African population sectors vulnerable to malaria epidemics. In addition, it develops a comprehensive supply chain map that reveals the labyrinths of the African logistics infrastructure, distribution channels, government regulations and business customs. Based on this supply chain map, this paper proposes various supply chain strategies that improve the access of anti-malarial drugs and reduce the possibility of drug supply chain disruptions. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",International Journal of Logistics Systems and Management,2012-02-27,10.1504/IJLSM.2012.044047
Smart objects in healthcare: Impact on clinical logistics,"Hospitals are confronted today with a plethora of approaches for asset management with RFID and WLAN, cooling chain monitoring using sensor networks and RFID, and patient tracking using virtually any existing technology. The downside is that most approaches are not necessarily compatible let alone coordinated. Further, none of the technologies is really integrated into legacy systems or corresponding organizational structures and processes, thus the full power of innovative applications is not utilized. Introducing the concept of smart objects inspired by the Internet of Things can improve the situation by separating the capabilities and functions of an object from the implementing technology such as RFID or WLAN. Wireless tags become interchangeable, and business applications can be built independent from the underlying communication network. Supported by synchronized technological and business developments smart objects have the power to transform a hospital from an agglomeration of technologies into a smart environment.",Critical Issues for the Development of Sustainable E-health Solutions,2012-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4614-1536-7_19

Patient journey modeling using integrated data structures in healthcare service operations,"Improving patient flow and patient satisfaction have attracted considerable interest in recent years. Recognizing the need for taking a holistic approach to improving healthcare service operations, this paper presents an integrated framework for patient journey modeling from admission through to discharge. The proposed framework enhances the capability of service delivery systems to cope with the uncertainty associated with planning and scheduling of healthcare service operations towards achieving the desired patient flow and satisfaction levels. The patient journey model developed based on the unitary structuring technique is illustrated using a selected healthcare scenario, identifying the patient flow with process and data elements, as well as information flows. It is shown that integration of processes, data elements, information flows and relationships enables modeling of patient journey for improving patient flow and satisfaction through effective and efficient planning of healthcare logistics. This patient journey model can be implemented in an enterprise resource planning system environment, as a software tool, for monitoring patient flow in real-time. © 2011 IEEE.","2011 IEEE Colloquium on Humanities, Science and Engineering, CHUSER 2011",2011-12-01,10.1109/CHUSER.2011.6163802
A case study of collaborative communications within healthcare logistics,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a collaborative communications model developed during the conduct of a recent academic research study and provide information to healthcare supply chain managers and administrators. Design/methodology/approach: Using data collected from a case study involving healthcare supply chain managers in the United States Army, this work examines how collaborative communications is linked to healthcare supply chain management. The findings associated with this study may have many transferable applications to institutions beyond a military health services context. Findings: This paper presents the findings and conclusions ascertained during a case study of collaborative communications. Five emerging themes were identified and a management model was developed for the enhancement of healthcare supply chain operations. Emerging themes included synergy among organizations, stakeholders working together, enhancements in supply chain operations, a continuance of training for supply chain leaders, and commonalities among disparate levels of management. Practical implications: Healthcare is a continually evolving industry. Supply chain efficiency can be linked to potential cost savings and more efficient operations within healthcare organizations. By understanding a model related to communicating collaboratively, leaders begin to understand the need for partnering among internal and external stakeholders and creating more efficient practices and processes. While this discussion is directed specifically toward healthcare management, the principles are applicable across a wide array of industries. Social implications: Communicating effectively is never easy for any healthcare organization or staff. Whether isolated to key individuals or throughout the entire organization, leaders have an inherent responsibility to share information and set conditions for organizational success. Arguably, the critical path to success involves effective, collaborative communications across multiple echelons of management responsibilities. Originality/value: While there is a dearth of literature examining communications and collaboration among various industries, little information is directed specifically toward the management of healthcare organizations or supply chain operations. In an applied sense, this model provides healthcare supply chain managers with concepts related to communicating more effectively at both the individual and organizational levels. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Leadership in Health Services,2011-02-01,10.1108/17511871111102526

Data standards in healthcare supply chain operations,"This paper presents the challenges and benefits associated with adoption of healthcare supply chain data standards in a hospital environment. In a highly fragmented industry like healthcare with several stakeholders, the adoption and use of common data standards for identifying delivery locations and products is critical. Common data standards ensure system wide interoperability and visibility across the supply chain, contributing to improvements in patient safety and streamlined internal and external supply chain operations. However, the global healthcare industry has been significantly slow in adopting data standards in comparison to other industries like retail, manufacturing. We discuss the results from data standard adoption pilot project conducted by Center for Innovation in Healthcare Logistics (CIHL), University of Arkansas at Washington Regional Medical Center, a 325 bed not-for-profit hospital in Fayet-teville, Arkansas. CIHL data standards pilot involved studying the existing supply chain processes, design, pilot-test, and evaluation of GS1 data standards adoption over a sample of products and a single delivery location at the hospital. We present the results, which demonstrate the capabilities of systemwide improvements and roadblocks likely to be encountered.

Managing processes on mobile devices: The marple approach,"Ubiquitous Computing is considered as enabler for linking everyday life with information and communication technology. However, developing pervasive applications that provide personalized user assistance is still a challenge. Relevant scenarios are diverse and encompass domains like healthcare, logistics, and business collaboration. Two of the technologies that show increasing maturity in respect to the demands of such applications are light-weight frameworks and process engines for mobile computing. Their fusion, however, is in a rather premature state. Generally, the support of mobile collaboration using a process engine raises challenging issues that need to be addressed. In the MARPLE project we target at a tight integration of process management technology with mobile computing frameworks in order to enable mobile process support in the aforementioned scenarios.

Red cell storage,"Blood component storage allows the donor and recipient to be separated in time and space. This separation converts transfusion from a desperate clinical act into a planned, orderly healthcare logistic activity with concomitant increases in both blood product availability and safety. However, storage has the potential to reduce the efficacy of transfused blood components by reducing their flow, functional capacity, and survival. Storage time also allows the accumulation of leaked potassium from red cells and the growth of contaminating bacteria. Many different aspects of the red cell storage lesion have been described, including changes in metabolism, shape, and rheology changes, loss of membrane carbohydrates, lipids and proteins, and alterations in secretion, oxygen delivery, and adhesion. What has been harder to show is that these known changes have significant clinical effects. Therefore, regulatory decisions about product storage have been conservative, and largely based on historic patterns of use. The increasing power of proteomics and metabolomics offers the potential of deeper understanding of blood function and storage and of better clinical products in the future. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Healthcare logistics: A comparative study in 12 hospitals,"Hospitals are characterized by, its complexity, the simultaneous presence of two distribution chains: the external and the internal. The external supply chain includes the multitude of different supplies and the distribution channels through which they flow. For the internal supply chain to the patient care units, hospitals must deploy their own distribution network. According to several studies, it is estimated that 46% of a hospital's total operating budget is spent on logistics related activities. Nursing staff will spend on average 10% of their time on logistic tasks. Due to the diversity of the healthcare materials management in hospitals, distributors were offering, instead of the conventional replenishment method, a stockless replenishment method, whereby the distributor picks and packs products, according to the needs of each patient care unit, and delivers them directly. The practices identified for the internal supply chain management systems are 1) on view, 2) par level systems or 3) the implementation of double container replenishment systems also called two bin or empty-full. The study shows that the hospitals of the survey have made supply chain integration efforts.
