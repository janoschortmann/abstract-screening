Enhancing healthcare supply chain management through artificial intelligence-driven group decision-making with Sugeno–Weber triangular norms in a dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy context,"The healthcare industry faces numerous challenges in managing its supply chain efficiently, where critical decisions must be made promptly to ensure the availability of essential medical resources. This research introduces a novel artificial intelligence (AI) approach, utilizing the “Sugeno–Weber (SW) t-conorms and t-norms” (SWt-CNs&t-Ns) for decision-making in a Dual Hesitant q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy (DHq-ROF) context. The SWt-CNs&t-Ns are chosen for their adaptability in data unification, serving as prominent operations for union and intersection processes. Developing a set of fundamental operations is imperative to effectively utilize SWt-CNs&t-Ns and hybrid aggregation operators in DHq-ROF settings. Following the introduction of these processes, several aggregating operators have been provided. These operators include DHq-ROF SW weighted averaging, ordered weighted averaging, hybrid averaging, and their geometric counterparts utilizing DHq-ROF data. The SW triangular norm-based approach aggregates group preferences, facilitating a systematic decision-making process. Triangular norms ensure a realistic representation of interrelationships among decision criteria, leading to optimal healthcare supply chain management solutions. Furthermore, the SW triangular norm-based approach aggregates group preferences, enabling a systematic and comprehensive decision-making process. Choosing the best healthcare supply chain management solutions is easier when you use triangular norms because they give a more accurate picture of how the decision criteria affect each other. The effectiveness of the proposed AI framework is demonstrated through a series of experiments and case studies, showcasing its ability to enhance decision accuracy, reduce uncertainty, and improve overall supply chain performance. The research findings underscore the potential of AI-driven solutions to revolutionize healthcare supply chain management, ultimately leading to better resource allocation, cost efficiency, and improved patient care.",Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2024-09-01,10.1016/j.engappai.2024.108794
Investigating the Impact of Drone Transport on the Stability of Monoclonal Antibodies for Inter-Hospital Transportation,"In the field of healthcare logistics, the reliance on conventional transport methods such as cars for the delivery of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is susceptible to challenges posed by traffic and infrastructure, leading to increased and unpredictable transport times. Recognizing the potential role of drones in mitigating these challenges, we aimed to investigate the impact of medical drone transport on the stability of mAbs. Compromised stability could lead to aggregation and immunogenicity, thereby jeopardizing the efficacy and safety of mAbs. We studied the transportation of vials as well as ready-to-administer infusion bags with blinatumomab, tocilizumab, and daratumumab. The methodology involved the measurement of both temperature and mechanical shock during drone transport. Moreover, the analytical techniques High Performance Size-Exclusion Chromatography (HP-SEC), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Light Obscuration (LO), Micro-Flow Imaging (MFI), and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) were employed to comprehensively assess the presence of aggregates and particle formation. The key findings revealed no significant differences between car and drone transport, indicating that the stability of mAbs in both vials and infusion bags was adequately maintained during drone transport. This suggests that medical drones are a viable and reliable means for the inter-hospital transport of mAbs, paving the way for more efficient and predictable logistics in healthcare delivery.",Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences,2024-07-01,10.1016/j.xphs.2024.04.002

Handling uncertainty in the specification of autonomous multi-robot systems through mission adaptation,"Multi-robot systems (MRS) have gained interest as a versatile paradigm for complex task execution across various domains such as healthcare, logistics, and maintenance. Often, they are called to operate in variable and dynamic environments, which makes uncertainties arise and affect those systems. Uncertainties require the system to be able to adapt its behavior at runtime, in response to the changing and unpredictable conditions in its operating environment. Moreover, often the behavior of the robots cannot be completely anticipated at design time. Consequently, static mission planning is not always suitable: mission specifications need to take into account the uncertainties and, hence, be dynamic and re-configurable at runtime, when the required knowledge is available.This work focuses on the realization of adaptable multi-robot systems, which are capable of dealing with uncertainties by adapting their mission at runtime. We introduce the concept of ""adaptable task"" that is used in the global mission specification of the MRS to identify the mission tasks affected by uncertainties. Adaptation alternatives are modeled as sub-missions and associated with the adaptable task. At runtime, ad hoc written ""trigger functions"" executed by robots sense and evaluate the environment and select the most suitable adaptation alternative to be executed.We have experimented with the approach by simulating a use case to assess its validity. The system was able to adapt its behavior in response to the environmental conditions, thus allowing the fulfillment of the mission goals. We also discuss the applicability of the use case on a set of known single- and multi-robot systems.","Proceedings - 2024 IEEE/ACM 19th Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems, SEAMS 2024",2024-04-15,10.1145/3643915.3644099
Home healthcare in Spanish rural areas: Applying vehicle routing algorithms to health transport management,"Depopulation of rural areas poses a range of new challenges for the provision of public services. Access to primary care centres is essential for promoting and protecting quality of life, especially for the older population. However, many rural municipalities face abandonment from public administrations by not even having a local clinic and forcing their dwellers to drive to the nearest facility. This research examines the adequacy of providing home healthcare (HHC) systems in such areas to avoid unnecessary trips. When designing routes to provide these services, decision-makers must take into account the following: (i) wide geographical spread of places to visit; (ii) difficulty in accessing some of these places with heavy medically equipped vehicles; and (iii) uncertainty regarding places to visit and availability of professionals. Our study identifies municipalities in which the travelling distance to the closest centre is above a desirable threshold, estimating the magnitude of the problem. Then, we provide an illustrative example in which an agile methodology is presented to design efficient routes that allow policymakers to offer HHC services of reasonable quality.",Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,2024-04-01,10.1016/j.seps.2024.101828

The UAV will be equipped with autonomous navigation capabilities, allowing it to operate without direct human intervention. This is particularly crucial in regions lacking proper infrastructure, where manual control may be impractical. The autonomous system will utilize GPS technology to ensure precise navigation and route planning, optimizing the efficiency of medical deliveries. To enhance the UAV's capability to operate in unpredictable environments, object detection systems will be integrated. This technology will enable the UAV to identify and navigate around obstacles such as trees, buildings, or uneven terrain. Utilizing a combination of cameras and ultrasonic sensors, the UAV will continuously scan its surroundings, making real-time decisions to avoid collisions and ensure a safe and reliable delivery path. The UAV's collision avoidance system will go beyond simple obstacle detection by actively predicting potential collision scenarios and taking preventive measures. This real-time decision-making process will be essential for navigating through challenging geographical landscapes like mountains and forests. In addition to its navigation and obstacle avoidance capabilities, the UAV will be equipped with a package deployment mechanism. This system will allow for the precise and controlled release of medical supplies at designated delivery points, ensuring that essential resources reach their intended destinations accurately and safely.

Navigating uncertain distribution problem: a new approach for resolution optimization of transportation with several objectives under uncertainty,"Amidst uncertainty, decision-making in manufacturing becomes a central focus due to its complexity. This study explores complex transportation constraints and uses novel ways to guide manufacturers. The Multi-objective Stochastic Linear Fractional Transportation Problem (MOSLFTP) is a crucial tool for managing supply chains, manufacturing operations, energy distribution, emergency routes, healthcare logistics, and other related areas. It adeptly addresses uncertainty, transforming efficiency and effectiveness in several domains.

AI-Enabled Techniques for Intelligent Transportation System for Smarter Use of the Transport Network for Healthcare Services,"Although intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and e-healthcare are two different fields, they can be integrated to offer a seamless and efficient experience to patients, attendants, relatives, and other relevant individuals. ITS can play a crucial role in supporting healthcare services by optimizing the use of transportation networks for treatment and e-healthcare logistic purposes. The combination of ITS and e-healthcare can provide patients with better and more efficient healthcare while also improving the overall transport experience. The biggest challenge in this integration is addressing the existing issues of a complex transportation system. Traffic administration organizations worldwide face the challenge of managing road traffic and networks. ITS, being an excellent mix of data and correspondence systems, seems the best solution that could contribute toward an effective and safe logistic environment alongside the long-term feasibility of transportation systems.

The COVID-19 pandemic and follow-up for shoulder surgery: The impact of a shift toward telemedicine on validated patient-reported outcomes,"Introduction: The emergence of COVID-19 and its ensuing restrictions on in-person healthcare has resulted in a sudden shift towards the utilization of telemedicine. The purpose of this study is to assess patient satisfaction and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for individuals who underwent follow-up for shoulder surgery using telemedicine compared to those who received traditional in-person clinic follow-up. Methods: Patients who underwent either rotator cuff repair or total shoulder arthroplasty during a designated pre-COVID-19 (traditional clinic follow-up) or peri-COVID-19 (telemedicine follow-up) span of time were identified. PROMs including the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons standardized assessment form, the three-level version of the EQ-5D form, the 12-Item Short Form survey, and a modified version of a published telemedicine survey were administered to participants six months post-operatively via phone call. Results: Sixty patients agreed to participate. There was no significant difference between the pre-COVID-19 and peri-COVID-19 groups in patient satisfaction with their follow-up visit (p = 0.289), nor was there a significant difference in PROMs between the two groups. In total, 83.33% of the telemedicine group and 70.37% of the in-person clinic group preferred traditional in-person follow-up over telemedicine. Discussion: In a cohort of patients who underwent telemedicine follow-up for shoulder surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no difference in patient satisfaction and PROMs compared to traditional in-person clinic follow-up. This study indicates that while the majority of participants preferred face-to-face visits, patients were relatively satisfied with their care and had similar functional outcome scores in both groups, despite the large disruption in healthcare logistics caused by COVID-19.",Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare,2023-07-01,10.1177/1357633X21990997
Divide and Conquer: A Location-Allocation Approach to Sectorization,"Sectorization is concerned with dividing a large territory into smaller areas, also known as sectors. This process usually simplifies a complex problem, leading to easier solution approaches to solving the resulting subproblems. Sectors are built with several criteria in mind, such as equilibrium, compactness, contiguity, and desirability, which vary with the applications. Sectorization appears in different contexts: sales territory design, political districting, healthcare logistics, and vehicle routing problems (agrifood distribution, winter road maintenance, parcel delivery). Environmental problems can also be tackled with a sectorization approach; for example, in municipal waste collection, water distribution networks, and even in finding more sustainable transportation routes. This work focuses on sectorization concerning the location of the area’s centers and allocating basic units to each sector. Integer programming models address the location-allocation problems, and various formulations implementing different criteria are compared. Methods to deal with multiobjective optimization problems, such as the (Formula presented.) -constraint, the lexicographic, and the weighted sum methods, are applied and compared. Computational results obtained for a set of benchmarking instances of sectorization problems are also presented.",Mathematics,2023-06-01,10.3390/math11112553
Efficient estimation of a risk measure requiring two-stage simulation optimization,"This paper is concerned with the efficient estimation of the risk measure of a system where the estimation requires solving a two-stage simulation optimization problem. The first stage samples risk factors that specify a second stage simulation optimization problem. The second stage solves a simulation optimization problem and outputs the best performance of the system under the realized risk factors, which are then aggregated across all first stage samples to produce an estimate of the risk measure. Applications of such an estimation scheme arise frequently in important industries such as financial, healthcare, logistics, and manufacturing. Because a large number of first stage samples are typically needed, each of which requires solving a computationally expensive simulation optimization problem, the two-stage simulation optimization approach faces a major computational efficiency challenge. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes a sequential simulation budget allocation procedure that determines the allocation of simulation budget based on a score known as revised probability of sign change for each decision under each scenario. The consistency of the proposed procedure is proved and the computational efficiency gain of the proposed is demonstrated using both benchmark test functions and two test cases in the context of financial portfolio risk estimation and healthcare system resilience estimation.",European Journal of Operational Research,2023-03-16,10.1016/j.ejor.2022.06.028
The influence of supply chain immunity perceptions on COVID-19 vaccine willingness in supply chain professionals,"Purpose: This study examines the lack of confidence in the actions of the government and pharmaceutical companies during vaccine deployment. The authors introduce the concept of supply chain immunity. The authors test whether the perception of higher vaccine supply chain immunity leads to higher willingness to be vaccinated within the supply chain community. Design/methodology/approach: The authors utilize factor analysis and item response theory methods to develop a scale for measuring supply chain immunity. The original and psychometrically sound scale is tested via a structural equation model (SEM). Factor analysis and SEM use survey responses from two samples of 125 supply chain executives. Findings: SEM suggests that supply chain immunity perceptions are a strong predictor of overall supply chain confidence for COVID vaccines. Further, these perceptions, through supply chain confidence, indirectly impact individuals' self-reported willingness to personally accept a vaccine themselves. Originality/value: This paper presents the concept of supply chain immunity perceptions that have not been used in the medical supply chain literature.

Mobile healthcare service planning in rural areas: A hybrid record to record travel algorithm,"Due to the economic infeasibility of establishing comprehensive healthcare facilities in sparsely populated areas and the responsibility of governments to ensure equal healthcare access for citizens, different approaches have been sought in healthcare service delivery. The Republic of Turkiye's Ministry of Health provides mobile healthcare services (MHS) to 9 million people monthly through 3400 healthcare facilities and 7500 doctors. This study focuses on the Mobile Healthcare Service Routing and Scheduling Problem (MHS-RSP). The objective of MHS-RSP is to determine the daily routes of doctors on a monthly basis to minimize total distance traveled, taking into account constraints such as working hours, route time, minimum service time per visit, and dedicated doctor assignments to villages. A mixed-integer mathematical model is developed to address the problem, which is NP-hard and equivalent to the multi-depot time-constrained periodic vehicle routing problem. To solve medium- and large-sized problems efficiently, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm named ""GCH-RRT"" is introduced, based on greedy constructive heuristic(GCH) and record-to-record travel(RRT) metaheuristic. The performance of the mathematical model and the GCH-RRT algorithm is compared with existing service plans in Ankara, resulting in a 15.6% improvement with the mathematical model and a 22.3% improvement with the GCH-RRT algorithm in total distance traveled.",Journal of the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture of Gazi University,2023-01-01,10.17341/gazimmfd.1218090
Hybridizing a matheuristic with ALNS for the optimal collection and delivery of medical specimens,"The past few years of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak have shown that optimal management of medical specimens is a key aspect of healthcare logistics, both for addressing the delivery of perishable items such as vaccines, and for ensuring the timely analysis of swabs and samples. Accordingly, recent optimization literature described the problem of optimal collection and delivery of medical specimens, modeled as a multitrip vehicle routing problem with time windows and a completion time objective function. Aiming to achieve good-quality solutions in short computational times, this work describes a hybrid approach, combining a matheuristic construction phase with an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS). Our matheuristic relies on a clustering algorithm to yield subsets of the medical specimens that are optimally served by single vehicles of the fleet. The solutions of the matheuristic phase serve as starting points for the ALNS intensification phase. Extensive experimentation on both new and established benchmark problem instances shows that our hybrid method is able to match the optimality of the state of the art on small instances and outperforms the existing exact method by one order of magnitude on larger problems.",International Transactions in Operational Research,2023-01-01,10.1111/itor.13386

Drivers and Barriers to Implementing the Internet of Things in the Health Care Supply Chain: Mixed Methods Multicase Study,"Background: Over the past 2 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed enormous pressure on the health care industry. There has been an increase in demand and, at the same time, a shortage of supplies. This has shown that supply chain management in the health care industry cannot be taken for granted. Furthermore, the health care industry is also facing other major challenges, such as the current labor market shortage. In the literature, the Internet of Things (IoT) is highlighted as an effective tool to build a more resilient and efficient supply chain that can manage these challenges. Although using IoT in supply chain management has been extensively examined in other types of supply chains, its use in the health care supply chain has largely been overlooked. Given that the health care supply chain, compared to others, is more complex and is under growing pressure, a more in-depth understanding of the opportunities brought by IoT is necessary. Objective: This study aims to address this research gap by identifying and ranking the drivers of and barriers to implementing IoT in the health care supply chain. Methods: We conducted a 2-stage study. In the first, exploratory stage, a total of 12 semistructured interviews were conducted to identify drivers and barriers. In the second, confirmatory stage, a total of 26 health care supply chain professionals were asked in a survey to rank the drivers and barriers. Results: The results show that there are multiple financial, operational, strategy-related, and supply chain-related drivers for implementing IoT. Similarly, there are various financial, strategy-related, supply chain-related, technology-related, and user-related barriers. The findings also show that supply chain-related drivers (eg, increased transparency, traceability, and collaboration with suppliers) are the strongest drivers, while financial barriers (eg, high implementation costs and difficulties in building a business case) are the biggest barriers to overcome. Conclusions: The findings of this study add to the limited literature regarding IoT in the health care supply chain by empirically identifying the most important drivers and barriers to IoT implementation. The ranking of drivers and barriers provides guidance for practitioners and health care provider leaders intending to implement IoT in the health care supply chain.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,2023-01-01,10.2196/48730

Future healthcare logistics: a survey of the public opinion on drones in Denmark,"Drones are expected to become widespread in society, making public readiness an important prerequisite for successfully unleashing them. This article investigates Danish citizens’ opinions on drones across varying fields of application and, specif-ically, six potential cases of healthcare logistics. Survey data representative of age, gender, and geography were collected and included information about respondents’ background, knowledge level of drones, and opinions on different drone use cases. Data were analysed with frequency tables and bivariate cross-tabulation. A thousand and four Danish adults completed the survey. Although other fields of application received higher levels of support, a majority of the respondents were positive towards using drones for healthcare logistics. Transportation of medicine and blood samples between hospitals were the most accepted healthcare use cases. Support varies across age with the highest support found in the eldest age group. Also, the more citizens report to know about drones, the more they tend to support using them. The results suggest that policymakers and firms must be attentive towards the public opinion on drones and seek insights into what citizens regard as noble purposes of using drones. Moreover, citizens must become more acquainted with drones, as this will likely boost public support.",Drone Systems and Applications,2023-01-01,10.1139/dsa-2022-0050
Transforming healthcare logistics and evaluating current use cases of UAVs (drones) as a method of transportation in healthcare to generate recommendations for the NHS to use drone technology at scale: a narrative review,"Drones have been pioneered and used in the military, however, only recently non-military drones have been introduced. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into focus the potential value of drones in moving medical supplies. With the onset of social distancing policies and quarantine regulations, the efficiency of traditional logistics systems has been limited. Several companies have recently accelerated their development in this domain, conducting pilot projects at pace, paving the way for the future of the medical logistics supply chain. In this review, we examine both narrative and grey literature for in and out of hospital settings, in order to describe the current state of drone technology in healthcare around the world and some of the most cutting-edge examples of how drones can benefits patients, clinicians and the wider public. We investigate the economic viability and barriers to adopting drones at scale which include regulatory hurdles, public perception and safety of drone technologies, and propose how to overcome these challenges. Further work should look at quantifying the impact and outcomes of how such a service could impact the health outcomes of patients and clinical efficiency. This review aims to equip the National Health Service and more broadly other healthcare systems around the world with the tools to embrace and implement this novel and upcoming technology.",BMJ Innovations,2023-01-01,10.1136/bmjinnov-2021-000861
Reorganisation of the internal storage and distribution logistics in a hospital,"This study involved the analysis and improvement of the internal distribution and storage at Hospital da Senhora da Oliveira - Guimaraes, a 500-beds general hospital in the north of Portugal. The study evolved around an action-research strategy that comprised five sequential and interconnected phases. Initially, the internal supply chain of the hospital was analysed with a special focus on ward warehouses (WW) and data about the logistics processes of the WW were gathered. Following, a prototype WW to test a set of innovative solutions aimed at dealing with the difficulties identified in the previous phase was developed. The proposed improvements were analysed and then implemented in the WW of a health care department, which lead to a new data collection about the performance of the logistics processes. The implementation of the proposed solutions resulted in a reduction of the time spent collecting, debiting and storing materials of 55% to 66%. It was also possible to reduce the error rate in these processes by 93%. When the proposed solutions are expanded to the whole hospital, in a year, it will be possible to save 4,819 hours in WW logistics processes (that can be dedicated to provide care to patients) and to avoid 115,843 errors",Procedia Computer Science,2023-01-01,10.1016/j.procs.2023.01.421
TOWARD MORE REALISTIC SIMULATION MODELS USING OBJECT-CENTRIC PROCESS MINING,"Discrete-event simulation has been around for over half a century with applications in production, healthcare, logistics, transportation, etc. However, it is still challenging to create a reliable simulation model that mimics the actual process well and allows for “what-if” questions. Process mining allows for the automated discovery of stochastic process models using event data extracted from information systems. This technology is one of the key enablers for creating digital shadows and digital twins of operational processes. However, traditional process mining focuses on individual cases (e.g., an order, a patient, or a train) with events just referring to a single object (the case). Therefore, the discipline is moving to Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM), where events can refer to any number of objects. Based on research on OCPM and the prototypes developed, now also commercial software vendors are embracing OCPM, as illustrated by Celonis Process Sphere, which allows for the discovery and analysis of object-centric process models. We believe that OCPM will help to create much more realistic simulation models. Whereas process discovery is backward-looking, with object-centric simulation models, we can also support forward-looking forms of process mining. Although such techniques still need to be developed, they provide a unique opportunity to create more realistic digital twins of organizations and their processes.","Proceedings - European Council for Modelling and Simulation, ECMS",2023-01-01,

Robotics Systems and Healthcare Logistics,"Including waste management, warehousing, inventory management, equipment maintenance, sanitation, and transportation, healthcare logistics has focused on providing more innovative and value-added services in recent years. Therefore healthcare services should be examined and aligned with the objectives of the entire healthcare supply chain to meet the needs of both individuals and organizations. This will help to improve the supply chain performance so that reflects on the patient outcomes. Lack of efficient storage areas, increasing wages/salaries, and some activities that are conducted by healthcare employees manually are the priority areas that require solutions. According to studies in the field of health logistics, supply chain activities take more than the time spent on patient care. In addition, the logistics activities that have to be done manually by the health personnel leave a negative impression on the patients. Based on these, healthcare logistics should be improved in order to decrease the level of fatigue of healthcare personnel and create more time to interact with patients. Serving various tasks and purposes in many business sector, robots are preparing to become one of the most important technological innovations for healthcare industry. Nowadays, the robotics community is largely focused on developing the next generation of service and social robots. It is predicted that the use of robots in diagnostics, surgery, rehabilitation, patient care, disinfection and cleaning, medicine and food distribution, vital signs measurement, disease prevention, and disease management will increase performance in healthcare services. Among these, robots providing disinfection and logistics services are predicted to have the shortest-term impact.","Accounting, Finance, Sustainability, Governance and Fraud",2023-01-01,10.1007/978-981-99-1818-8_7

The Dial-a-Ride Problem with School Bell Time Adjustment,"In this paper, we study a paratransit application in which children are transported every day from their homes to their special schools or medical-social establishments. To optimize this transportation system, the establishments collaborate to propose a joint transportation plan. We propose a new algorithm to jointly build vehicle routes that visit several establishments and simultaneously set the establishments’ opening hours. This algorithm combines a large neighborhood search, the resolution of a route-based model, and the progressive shrinkage of the planning window. It is applied to a real case from the area of Lyon in France, including 34 schools and 575 heterogeneous users served by a heterogeneous fleet of reconfigurable vehicles. On average, we show that in addition to the 10% of saving that can be expected by sharing vehicle routes between schools, 7% of additional savings can be achieved by school bell adjustment. This cost saving also decreases average user ride times and the number of vehicles required, creating longer routes that are more attractive for driver services.",Transportation Science,2023-01-01,10.1287/trsc.2022.1160
Simheuristic and learnheuristic algorithms for the temporary-facility location and queuing problem during population treatment or testing events,"Epidemic outbreaks, such as the one generated by the coronavirus disease, have raised the need for more efficient healthcare logistics. One of the challenges that many governments have to face in such scenarios is the deployment of temporary medical facilities across a region with the purpose of providing medical services to their citizens. This work tackles this temporary-facility location and queuing problem with the goals of minimising costs, the expected completion time, population travel time, and waiting time. The completion time for a facility depends on the numbers assigned to those facilities as well as stochastic arrival times. This work proposes a learnheuristic algorithm to solve the facility location and population assignment problem. Firstly a machine learning algorithm is trained using data from a queuing model (simulation module). The learnheuristic then constructs solutions using the machine learning algorithm to rapidly evaluate decisions in terms of facility completion and population waiting times. The efficiency and quality of the algorithm is demonstrated by comparison with exact and simulation-only (simheuristic) methodologies. A series of experiments are performed which explore the trade-offs between solution cost, completion time, population travel time, and waiting time.",Journal of Simulation,2023-01-01,10.1080/17477778.2023.2166879

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Adaptation to Facilitate Healthcare Supply Chains in Low-Income Countries,"Low-income countries are persistently suffering from last-mile logistics issues in healthcare supply chains. Therefore, it is high time to explore technological applications to overcome such inadequacies. The faster speed, low maintenance cost, and absence of road dependency in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have popularized them as an alternative to road delivery. Hence, it is suggested as a solution to overcome the persisting distribution inefficiencies in healthcare logistics of low-income countries. According to the case study analysis conducted on the Sri Lankan vaccine cold chain, incorporating UAVs increases truck-space utilization and reduces the time consumed, cost incurred, and carbon dioxide emission in a delivery round. Moreover, the most suitable way to cover the initial setup cost of an unmanned aerial system (UAS) is by receiving aid from international donors. The capital cost also can be covered by government investments or via service outsourcing only if the number of flights per year is increased. Moreover, a homogenous (i.e., only UAV) solution was revealed to be more beneficial than a heterogeneous (i.e., truck and UAV) solution. However, due to the lack of technology literacy and willingness to change in low-income countries, it is recommended to initially execute a heterogeneous solution and expand to a homogeneous plan in the future years. However, it was evident that for a mixed-fleet solution to be advantageous, drone characteristics play a vital role. Hence, a UAV with specifications ideal for the use case must be utilized to garner the maximum benefits. Nevertheless, it was apparent that with the right implementation plan, UAVs possess the potential to overcome the shortcomings in the healthcare logistics of low-income countries.",Drones,2022-11-01,10.3390/drones6110321
Cooperative Blood Inventory Ledger (CoBIL): A decentralized decision-making framework for improving blood product management,"Inefficiencies in blood product management systems, including segmented operations, lack of detailed data sharing, and limited real-time visibility, can often result in significant annual losses in product wastage and postponed medical procedures. Left unaddressed, the negative impact on patient health and healthcare systems can be substantial as blood donations continue to decline. This paper proposes the Cooperative Blood Inventory Ledger (CoBIL), a blockchain and smart-contract enabled system designed to mitigate some of these inefficiencies by increasing cooperation among all echelons of the blood supply chain, without sacrificing entity privacy and competition. The proposed framework facilitates collaborative decision-making among all stakeholders to distribute blood products across healthcare networks and reduce system costs. It also facilitates product redistribution among hospitals and other transfusion points to reduce losses due to expired product or canceled medical procedures due to product shortages. A role-based smart contract is included in the framework to define stakeholder access and manage data exchange. To analyze the feasibility of the proposed framework, we implement a proof of concept on a local machine using Hyperledger fabric's test network and employ it to simulate transactions required for the inventory operations of a regional blood supply chain.",Computers and Industrial Engineering,2022-10-01,10.1016/j.cie.2022.108571
The impact of counterfeit risk management on healthcare supply chain performance: an empirical analysis,"Purpose: This study develops and tests a model exploring the relationship between supply chain (SC) counterfeit risk management and performance in the healthcare supply chain (HCSC). Design/methodology/approach: In the proposed theoretical model, HCSC counterfeit risk management is characterized by HCSC counterfeit risk orientation (HCRO), HCSC counterfeit risk mitigation (HCRM) and HCSC risk management integration (HRMI), while performance is represented by healthcare logistics performance (HLP) and healthcare organization overall performance (HOP). Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and survey data from 55 HCSC managers are used to test the research hypotheses. Findings: HCRO has a significant positive effect on HCRM, while HCRM has a positive impact on HRMI. With respect to HLP, HCRM has a nonsignificant effect, while HRMI has a significant impact, thus confirming the important mediating role of HRMI. Finally, HLP has a significant positive effect on the overall performance of healthcare organizations. Research limitations/implications: All study participants were from the United States, limiting the generalizability of the study findings to different countries or regions. The sample size employed in the study did not allow the authors to distinguish among the different types of healthcare organizations. Originality/value: This study delineates between a healthcare organization's philosophy toward counterfeiting risks vs actions taken to eliminate or reduce the impact of counterfeiting on the HCSC. By offering firm-level guidance for managers, this study informs healthcare organizations about addressing the challenge of counterfeiting in the HCSC.",International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management,2022-08-16,10.1108/IJPPM-08-2020-0426
The multi-trip vehicle routing problem with increasing profits for the blood transportation: An iterated local search metaheuristic,"This paper studies a multi-trip routing problem of a shuttle fleet to transport blood units from collection sites to a blood center. In this problem, the blood units intended to produce platelets and cryoprecipitate must be processed within eight hours from their donation and arrive at the blood center at a time less than its closing time to guarantee enough processing time. Since it is assumed that blood units are donated at a collection site following a constant ratio over its operating hours, this problem is modeled as a multi-trip vehicle routing problem with increasing profits for which a mixed-integer linear programming formulation is proposed. A hybrid iterated local search metaheuristic and an extended version are developed as solution methods. The extended version includes a mixed-integer linear programming component into the local search of the hybrid metaheuristic to optimize the decision on the departure times of the trips. The solution methods are tested on a new set of instances based on the blood collection system of Bogota, Colombia.",Computers and Industrial Engineering,2022-08-01,10.1016/j.cie.2022.108294

Transportation-Induced Carbon Emissions Jeopardize Healthcare Logistics Sustainability: Toward a Healthier Today and a Better Tomorrow,"Background: Logistics operations are considered essential for transporting commodities from one location to another, helping to promote global economic activity. On the other hand, its negative impact eclipses its positive impact, namely the rise in healthcare expenditures due to its ecological footprint. Globally, rising out-of-pocket health expenses result from logistic-induced carbon emissions, posing a danger to the long-term viability of healthcare. Methods: Based on this critical fact, this study examined the impact of logistics operations on healthcare costs by controlling for carbon emissions, fuel imports, and economic development across a large cross-section of 131 nations by using the Robust Least Squares Regression. Results: The findings demonstrate a U-shaped association between logistical operations and healthcare expenditures, i.e., if there is a 1% increase in logistics operations, healthcare expenditures decrease by −2.421% initially, while at later stages, healthcare costs would increase by 0.139%. On the other hand, increased fuel imports and economic growth due to logistics activities are increasing healthcare expenditures with an elasticity estimate of 0.087% and 0.147%, respectively. According to the forecasting predictions, logistics-induced carbon emissions, fuel imports, and economic expansion will increase healthcare expenses. Conclusions: A sustainable logistics operation is critical for strengthening healthcare infrastructure and meeting the global carbon neutrality goal.",Logistics,2022-06-01,10.3390/logistics6020027
Stochastic medical tourism problem with variable residence time considering gravity function,"Medical tourism is a recent term in healthcare logistics referring to travel of patients to receive health services and spending leisure time in a destination country. This transferring of patients leads to access high-quality health services which are cheaper than the original country of patients. During this travel, passengers who are the patients from another country, have this opportunity for complimentary entertainment packages (e.g., pleasure tours) in the aftercare period. As far as we know, the term of medical tourism is rarely studied in healthcare logistics and such services are highly important for developing countries. Such facts motivate us to develop a practical optimization model for the Medical Tour Centers (MTCs) for allocation of patients to hospitals in proper time and creation of memorable aftercare time for them. In this regard, the main aim of the proposed model is to maximize the total profit of MTCs through optimal allocation of patients to hospitals while considering an aftercare tour for the passengers. To make the proposed model more realistic, the optimal residence time in attractive places is simulated by a time-dependent gravity function. To address the uncertainty of medical tourism problem, a scenario-based two-stage stochastic optimization approach is extended to encounter different sources of uncertainty existing in surgical success, medical time, restoration restrictions, and the attraction of tourist places. Another novelty of this work is to propose an innovative hybrid meta-heuristic for large-scale instances, which is a combination of Progressive Hedging Algorithm (PHA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The model is analyzed by different test problems for small, medium, and large-scale instances where the hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm could solve them with an average gap of 3.4% in comparison with the commercial solver. The results revealed the importance of tourist opinion and public preferences in medical and pleasure tours, respectively, to improve the economic growth in this sector in developing countries.",RAIRO - Operations Research,2022-05-01,10.1051/ro/2022082
Fleet sizing and routing of healthcare automated guided vehicles,"This paper proposes techniques to improve the efficiency of transportation activities within hospitals. Transportation is a major activity in hospitals which requires management efforts to improve its efficiency and increase the quality of patient services. One of the most powerful ways of achieving more efficiency of transportation systems in hospitals is via the labor-saving technology of logistics processes using automated guided vehicles (AGVs). In this paper, we study the fleet sizing and routing problem with synchronization for AGVs with dynamic demands (FSRPS-AGV) in the context of a real-life application. The goal is to simultaneously optimize the number and types of carts and AGVs needed to perform all daily requests in a hospital while optimizing AGVs’ routes and respecting time constraints. Different requests require different types of carts, which are transported by the AGVs. Each request is composed of several tasks consisting of moving material from a pickup point to a delivery point. Operation synchronization among the tasks of the same request (task 1 must be performed before task 2, possibly by different AGVs but using the same cart) and movement synchronization with respect to AGVs and carts (an AGV may drop off a cart, and later another AGV picks up the cart to continue serving the same or another request) are major challenges of the addressed problem. In this paper, we describe, model, and solve the FSRPS-AGV. We introduce a mathematical formulation and propose a powerful matheuristic based on a fast and efficient dynamic reoptimization of the routes upon the arrival of new requests. We compare the performance of our matheuristic under different scenarios, including against the solutions obtained by an oracle, showing that it can handle dynamism of demand very well and achieve near-optimal solutions. We assess our methods using small and large instances generated based on real data from an industrial partner. We demonstrate that significant performance improvements and important savings can be achieved with a small degree of flexibility in timing constraints and less conservative speed estimations (while taking into account safety concerns). Finally, we provide managerial insights with respect to the number of AGVs and carts that should be acquired by our industrial partner.",Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,2022-05-01,10.1016/j.tre.2022.102679
Sustainable and Robust Home Healthcare Logistics: A Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Today, research on healthcare logistics is an important challenge in developing and developed countries, especially when a pandemic such as COVID-19 occurs. The responses required during such a pandemic would benefit from an efficiently designed model for robust and sustainable healthcare logistics. In this study, we focus on home healthcare logistics and services for planning the routing and scheduling of caregivers to visit patients’ homes. Due to the need for social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, these services are highly applicable for reducing the growth of the epidemic. In addition to this challenge, home healthcare logistics and services must be redesigned to meet the standards of a triple bottom line approach based on sustainable development goals. A triple bottom line approach finds a balance between economic, environmental, and social criteria for making a sustainable decision. Although, recently, the concept of green home healthcare has been studied based on the total cost and green emissions of home healthcare logistics and services, as far as we know, no research has been conducted on the formulation of a triple bottom line approach for home healthcare logistics and services. To achieve social justice for caregivers, the goal of balancing working time is to find a balance between unemployment time and overtime. Another contribution of this research is to develop a scenario-based robust optimization approach to address the uncertainty of home healthcare logistics and services and to assist with making robust decisions for home healthcare planning. Since our multi-objective optimization model for sustainable and robust home healthcare logistics and services is more complex than other studies, the last novel contribution of this research is to establish an efficient heuristic algorithm based on the Lagrangian relaxation theory. An initial solution is found by defining three heuristic algorithms. Our heuristic algorithms use a symmetric pattern for allocating patients to pharmacies and planning the routing of caregivers. Then, a combination of the epsilon constraint method and the Lagrangian relaxation theory is proposed to generate high-quality Pareto-based solutions in a reasonable time period. Finally, an extensive analysis is done to show that our multi-objective optimization model and proposed heuristic algorithm are efficient and practical, as well as some sensitivities are studied to provide some managerial insights for achieving sustainable and robust home healthcare services in practice.",Symmetry,2022-02-01,10.3390/sym14020193

Artificial Intelligence for Smart Cities: Locational Planning and Dynamic Routing of Emergency Vehicles,"To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of essential emergency services such as ambulances, fire brigades, and police, one of the most important problems to tackle is to minimize the response times of these emergency vehicles. As well as attaining optimal waiting sites and deployment strategies for the emergency vehicles, the optimal routing and traffic preemption of the vehicles are also crucial in minimizing response times and maximizing coverage. As locational planning and dynamic routing of the emergency vehicles relate to many different situations with varying emergency levels, they are a crucial part of the smart city concept.

A Locational Analysis Model of the COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution,"Even and equitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine becomes one of key strategies to reduce the number of positive cases and virus transmissions all over the world. This paper aims to introduce and demonstrate a mathematical model based on a maximal covering location problem (MCLP) to optimise the coverage of the COVID-19 vaccine distribution. A mathematical model is proposed and demonstrated using an illustrative case study of healthcare facilities and location coordinates of villages in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. A numerical computer experiment is conducted to obtain optimal results of the locational analysis. The results show that the proposed model provides an efficient coverage of vaccination by minimising the distances travelled by the target population. It also reveals an interesting insight that prioritising vaccination for areas with high COVID-19 cases results in a less efficient coverage. The novel location-allocation model for COVID-19 vaccination facilities proposed in this paper particularly applies in a developing country.

Optimising the booking horizon in healthcare clinics considering no-shows and cancellations,"Patient no-shows and cancellations are a significant problem to healthcare clinics, as they compromise a clinic's efficiency. Therefore, it is important to account for both no-shows and cancellations into the design of appointment systems. To provide additional empirical evidence on no-show and cancellation behaviour, we assess outpatient clinic data from two healthcare providers in the USA and EU: no-show and cancellation rates increase with the scheduling interval, which is the number of days from the appointment creation to the date the appointment is scheduled for. We show the temporal cancellation behaviour for multiple scheduling intervals is bimodally distributed. To improve the efficiency of clinics at a tactical level of control, we determine the optimal booking horizon such that the impact of no-shows and cancellations through high scheduling intervals is minimised, against a cost of rejecting patients. Where the majority of the literature only includes a fixed no-show rate, we include both a cancellation rate and a time-dependent no-show rate. We propose an analytical queuing model with balking and reneging, to determine the optimal booking horizon. Simulation experiments show that the assumptions of this model are viable. Computational results demonstrate general applicability of our model by case studies of two hospitals.",International Journal of Production Research,2022-01-01,10.1080/00207543.2021.1913292
Nonmedical barriers to early steps in kidney transplantation among underrepresented groups in the United States,"Purpose of reviewDespite numerous targeted interventions and policy reforms, underrepresented minorities and patients with low socioeconomic status (SES) continue to have unequal a to kidney transplant. In this review, we summarize the most recent evidence on barriers to early kidney transplant steps (i.e. referral and evaluation) among underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities and low SES groups in the United States.Recent findingsThis review highlights the interconnectedness of several patient-level (e.g. medical mistrust, transplant knowledge, a to care), provider-level (e.g. dialysis profit status, patient-provider communication; staff aibility), and system-level (e.g. center-specific criteria, healthcare logistics, neighborhood poverty, healthcare logistics) factors associated with lower rates of referral and evaluation among underrepresented minorities and low SES groups, and the influence of systemic racism operating at all levels.SummaryCollection of national surveillance data on early transplant steps, as well as routinely captured data on upstream social determinants of health, including the measurement of racism rather than race, is necessary to enhance our understanding of barriers to referral and evaluation. A multipronged approach (e.g.Targeted and systemwide interventions, and policy change) implemented at multiple levels of the healthcare system will be necessary to reduce disparities in early transplant steps.",Current Opinion in Organ Transplantation,2021-10-01,10.1097/MOT.0000000000000903

Involving Motorbikes in Blood Pickup Services: A Mathematical Modelling Perspective,"The inclusion of smaller-size vehicles to enhance the performance of logistics systems has been a new trend in logistics, spanning from bicycles to drones. On the other hand, the motorbike has long been known as a common transportation mode, especially in developing countries, which opens the possibility to implement this vehicle mode in a healthcare logistics environment. Therefore, in this article, we discuss the possibility to involve a motorbike in the blood pickup service system. Here, we propose to mathematically model the system as a blood pickup routing problem with heterogeneous vehicle modes (BPRP-HV). Numerical experiments are then conducted, and managerial insights are derived from the results.","2021 5th Annual Systems Modelling Conference, SMC 2021",2021-09-14,10.1109/SMC53803.2021.9569938
Scalability improvement and analysis of permissioned-blockchain,"Through the Bitcoin application, the innovative technology was miraculously launched in the markets, influencing numerous industries.

Impacts of Losses Functions on the Quality of the Ultrasound Image by Using Machine Learning Algorithms,"During last decade, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been able to reshape our life daily. Different areas were positively impacted by AI such as Healthcare, Logistic, etc. Medical imaging is one of the fields of healthcare in which AI was introduced to solve and overcome different problems. Challenges including image processing, signal processing, and data acquisition. In this paper, we deeply demonstrate the loss function as one of the main parameters that influence the quality of the ultrasound (US) image. Therefore, we introduce the main components of ultrasound systems form end-to-end perspective such as the data acquisition, the signal processing, and the image interpretation. Then, we present the losses functions as a critical performance metrics for the model validation. Metrics such as the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Cross-Entropy loss function (CE), Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), and the Structural Similarity (SSIM). After that we present the adopted CNN model to generate ultrasound image. The excessive simulation results demonstrate that the selection of the loss function provides significant improvement in terms of image quality (e.g., contrast, CNR and SNR). Choosing simple loss functions such as mean square error helps to faster the convergence of the convolution neural network during the training process. However, for image quality enhancement, we propose the combination of different loss functions such structural similarity (SSIM) with Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).","2021 IEEE International Conference on Automatic Control and Intelligent Systems, I2CACIS 2021 - Proceedings",2021-06-26,10.1109/I2CACIS52118.2021.9495878

From network approach to ecosystem approach: A new framework for change management,"The actual change management models drawn from literature are focused only on the perspective of a single organisation. This perspective is not coherent with the new business scenario created by the pervasive use of digital technologies, which requires a new way to deal with organizational change. In particular, organizations have to manage change in a collaborative way, reflecting a progressive shift from a network to an ecosystem approach. Starting from this perspective, this paper aim to present a change on management framework in order to manage innovation within a complex digital ecosystem of actors. Coherently with this goal, the proposed framework will be articulated in a series of phases that have to be considered in the change process within an ecosystem. For each phase, the research will present the most common issues faced by organizations together with the corresponding change management actions. These actions are categorized in short-term and long-term. Moreover, the paper provides a set of indicators that can be used to monitor the effectiveness of the various change management actions. Finally, the validity of the change management framework will be proved thanks to its application in a project of digital innovation in healthcare domain.

Hybrid predetection technique for efficient tag identification in radio-frequency identification systems,"Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is a noncontact automatic identification technology that has been widely used in various modern industries. Due to the continuous improvement in sensing capabilities, energy autonomy, affordability, and usability, RFID is one of the key enabling technologies in realizing the Internet of Things (IoT). With their non-line-of-sight wireless transmission, wireless power, and sensing capability, lightweight RFID sensor tags can be connected to people or objects, which is crucial for future IoT applications such as healthcare, logistics, and manufacturing. The RFID approach with the simultaneous reading of multiple tag features can quickly identify connected “things” for further data communication and integration. Reducing the identification processing time for many tags located inside the interrogation range of the reader is essential. Therefore, an effective protocol must be developed to prevent collisions and reduce useless queries between the reader and tags to achieve rapid identification. Predetection tree-based algorithms, which are based on certain small predetection timeslots that tags can respond to, can eliminate unnecessary idle slots and prevent collision slots. In this paper, an efficient predetection-based anticollision algorithm has been proposed to achieve outstanding tag identification performance. The numbers of collision slots and idle slots are reduced by exploiting a novel predetection mechanism and slot size adjustment technique. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme reduces the tag identification time by approximately 30-60% compared with previously proposed predetection-based protocols. Moreover, the numbers of query cycles, collisions, and slots are smaller in the proposed scheme than in the previously proposed protocols.",Sensors and Materials,2021-01-01,10.18494/SAM.2021.3381
A Mobile Healthcare Service Routing and Scheduling Problem in Rural Areas,"A change in health policy become essential since healthcare needs of societies have changed over the past sixty years. It is not possible to build a hospital wherever people live especially in less populated settlements. However, equal access of people to health services must be ensured by governments. To tackle this issue, Turkey Ministry of Health has enforced to give mobile healthcare services in rural areas by approximately 7.5 thousand doctors located in 3.4 thousand medical centers. These doctors work 8 h/day and give mobile healthcare service to approximately 9 million people each month. This study considers Turkey rural healthcare delivery system as a Multi-depot Time Constrained Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem (md-TCPVRP) and presents a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the problem. The goal is to derive daily routes of the doctors each month, under some constraints such as maximum workhours, route duration, minimum service time per visit, assigning dedicated doctors to villages while minimizing the total route distance. In order to investigate the performance of the model a computational experiment is carried.

Hybrid Intelligent System for Medical Diagnosis in Health Care,"The autonomous city implies a global vision that incorporates artificial intelligence, deep learning, big data, decision-making, ICT and the Internet of Things (IoT) to promote sustainable development. The ageing issue is that researchers, companies and the government should devote efforts to developing smart health care, innovative technology and applications. For an extended period, conventional intelligence systems have played a critical role in health care. However, with the increased popularity and widespread use of these hybrid intelligent computer systems, there is a significant shift in the healthcare sector. Diagnosis and detection of various diseases using several techniques can be resolved by using these techniques. Different novel methods are applied to biomedical engineering to diagnose diseases, and new models are being studied and compared with the existing technologies. Hybrid intelligence systems can be implied in decision-making, remote monitoring, healthcare logistics, medical diagnosis, and modern information system. This success's fundamental cause seems to be derived by different intelligent computational mechanisms, such as genetic algorithms, evolutionary computation, convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), autoencoders, deep generative models and deep belief networks. To solve complex problems, we need domain knowledge that comprises the methodologies that provide hybrid systems with complementary reasoning and empirical data.

A Decision Support Tool for the Location Routing Problem During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Colombia,"During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Bogotá, Colombia, some strategies for dealing with the increasing number of infected people and the level of occupation of intensive care units include the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). PPE is a crucial component for patient care and a priority for protecting healthcare workers. For attending this necessity, the location of distribution centers within the city and the corresponding routes to supply the intensive care units (ICU) with PPE have an important role. Formally, this problem is defined as the Location Routing Problem (LRP). The LRP is an NP-Hard problem that combines the Facility Location Problem (FLP) and the Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Depots (MDVRP). This work presents a decision support tool based on a simheuristic method that hybridize an Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm with Monte Carlo simulation to deal with the LRP with uncertain demands. Realistic data from Bogotá (Colombia) was retrieved using Google Maps to characterize the geographical distribution of both potential facilities and ICUs, while demands were generated using the uniform probability distribution. Our preliminary results suggest the competitiveness of the algorithm in both the deterministic and the stochastic versions of the LRP.",Communications in Computer and Information Science,2021-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-76310-7_3

A quickly deployed and UAS-based logistics network for delivery of critical medical goods during healthcare system stress periods: A real use case in Valencia (Spain),"On the one hand, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) have experienced great applicability surge in the recent years, arising as a promising technology with a wide field of use. On the other hand, healthcare, a critical system in modern society, is subject to a heavy and unexpected pressure in the case of situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This article aims to leverage the flexibility of UASs as complementary support for healthcare logistic systems when under high-stress conditions, via quick deployment of an air delivery network. We have defined a logistics network model and created three scenarios based on the model and current needs in Valencia (Spain). Flight tests have been performed in these scenarios, which include urban areas and controlled airspace. Operations complied with requirements derived from the application of Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA) methodology, recently adopted by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Flights were successful, being able to swiftly deliver medical goods without requiring any dedicated infrastructure. However, a moderate number of contingencies took place during the tests, mainly related to control link quality and Air Traffic Management (ATM) integration, forcing the use of dedicated procedures to cope with them. Although additional development is required to ensure the safety of large-scale automated operations, the use of UASs as part of logistic networks is a feasible means to support existing structures, especially in situations in dire need.",Drones,2021-01-01,10.3390/DRONES5010013

An iterated local search for the biomedical sample transportation problem with multiple and interdependent pickups,"This article addresses a new version of the biomedical sample transportation problem, as a vehicle routing problem with precedence constraints arising in the context of healthcare logistics, and proposes an iterated local search algorithm to solve it. This new version is more realistic and complex since it considers the collection centres’ opening hours and the moment at which they are visited as decision variables, granting additional flexibility to elaborate more efficient routes. Indeed, this problem is harder to model and to solve than its previous version because the constraint on the short samples’ lifetime leads to interdependency between successive pickups at each collection center. A metaheuristic is thus proposed to solve real-life instances. Numerical experiments confirm (1) the value of simultaneously planning routes, opening hours, and visit hours (which is new in the literature) and (2) the efficiency of the proposed algorithm to solve this problem.",Journal of the Operational Research Society,2021-01-01,10.1080/01605682.2019.1657369
A multi-agents system for solving facility layout problem: Application to operating theater,"Facility layout problem (FLP) has a great impact on the efficiency of any organization. It is concerned with defining the optimal location for each facility in order to optimize the supply chain productivity. In this kind of problems, the choice of resolution approach depends on the complexity and the size of the problem. Operating theaters are generally big structures containing a lot of facilities, which makes the conception of their layout a complex problem. In the literature, exact methods are powerless when faced with problem sizes up to 18 facilities. This leads us to explore other approaches, looking for efficient solutions. This paper presents a novel approach using a multi-agents system where agents' skills are exploited to cover a wide research space, to accelerate the decision-making process and to deal with real-life problem sizes. This decision-making tool is based on several mixed integer linear programming models for solving the FLP, and considers two types of environments with deterministic and variant patient demand. Several experiments have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and several problem instances with >80 facilities have been solved in reasonable time.",Journal of Intelligent Systems,2021-01-01,10.1515/jisys-2017-0081
Implementation of a new echocardiographic practice during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Due to the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, healthcare logistics have changed abruptly and significantly in all medical specialties, of which cardiovascular services are no exception. Assessment of urgent and priority cases did not stop, both medical personnel and patients required adaptation of personal protective measures to prevent the spread of a highly contagious and potentially fatal virus for this vulnerable population with cardiovascular disease. In the time that has elapsed since the beginning of said pandemic to date, the health sector has become immersed in a fortuitous and challenging situation for its work environment. Considering that this virus could remain endemic, it is necessary to devise a protocol for a gradual and safe reincorporation of services at all levels of care. This document provides an update on recommendations for the return to a safe but no less efficient echocardiographic practice, based on expert opinions, some international guidelines along with evidence available until recently on several main echocardiographic findings in patients with cardiovascular disease by COVID-19, providing a general approach that can be adapted to the guidelines of each health institution in this country.",Cardiovascular and Metabolic Science,2020-10-01,10.35366/97548
A healthcare logistic network considering stochastic emission of contamination: Bi-objective model and solution algorithm,"This paper presents a novel healthcare waste location-routing problem by concentrating on a new perspective in healthcare logistics networks. In this problem, there are healthcare, treatment, and disposal centers. Locations of healthcare centers are known, however, it is required to select appropriate locations for treatment, recycling, and disposal centers. Healthcare wastes are divided into infectious and non-infectious wastes. Since a great volume of healthcare wastes are infectious, the emission of contamination can have obnoxious impacts on the environment. The proposed problem considers a stochastic essence for the emission of contamination which depends on the transferring times. In this respect, transferring times between healthcare and treatment centers have been considered as normal random variables. As transferring time increases, it is more likely for the contamination to spread. Having visited a treatment center, infectious wastes are sterilized and they will no longer be harmful to the environment. This research develops a bi-objective mixed-integer mathematical formulation to tackle this problem. The objectives of this model are minimization of total costs and emission of contamination, simultaneously. Complexity of the proposed problem led the researchers to another contribution. This study also develops a Multi-Objective Water-Flow like Algorithm (MOWFA), which is a meta-heuristic, to solve the problem. This algorithm uses a procedure based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to rank the non-dominated solutions in the archive set. By means of a developed mating operator, the MOWFA utilizes the best ranked solutions of the archive in order to obtain high quality offspring. Two neighborhood operators have been designed for the MOWFA as the local search methods. Extensive computational experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the MOWFA on several test problems compared with other meta-heuristics, namely the Multi-Objective Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (MOICA) and Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA). These experiments also include a real healthcare waste logistic network in Iran. The computational experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm prevails these algorithms in terms of some well-known performance evaluation measures.",Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,2020-10-01,10.1016/j.tre.2020.102060
A fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis approach for risk evaluation in healthcare logistics outsourcing: Case of Morocco,"Public–private partnerships in emerging countries are gradually considered a tool for growth development. One particular public–private partnership is that of outsourcing logistics in the healthcare sector. These partnerships provide several benefits for both private and public sectors but are generally associated with numerous risks that must be evaluated and subsequently managed. The aim in this paper is to develop a risk evaluation approach to rank risks when decision makers’ judgment is taken into consideration and where traditional risk evaluation techniques become less applicable. The proposed approach makes use of fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis methods since they are efficient techniques to rank alternatives based on selected evaluation criteria and can accommodate human judgment and preferences. The approach treats predetermined risks like alternatives, and evaluation criteria are represented by areas of impact of the risks. To validate the approach, we applied it to a real case of logistics outsourcing to private service providers in a Moroccan public pharmaceutical supply chain. The ranking results obtained show that the two methods lead to some differences in ranking but are highly correlated. The obtained results support healthcare policy makers in setting priorities to effectively deploy preventive and mitigation efforts.",Health Services Management Research,2020-08-01,10.1177/0951484820901668
ONLINE CAPACITY PLANNING for REHABILITATION TREATMENTS: AN APPROXIMATE DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING APPROACH,"We study an online capacity planning problem in which arriving patients require a series of appointments at several departments, within a certain access time target. This research is motivated by a study of rehabilitation planning practices at the Sint Maartenskliniek hospital (the Netherlands). In practice, the prescribed treatments and activities are typically booked starting in the first available week, leaving no space for urgent patients who require a series of appointments at a short notice. This leads to the rescheduling of appointments or long access times for urgent patients, which has a negative effect on the quality of care and on patient satisfaction. We propose an approach for allocating capacity to patients at the moment of their arrival, in such a way that the total number of requests booked within their corresponding access time targets is maximized. The model considers online decision making regarding multi-priority, multi-appointment, and multi-resource capacity allocation. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that takes into account the current patient schedule, and future arrivals. We develop an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to obtain approximate optimal capacity allocation policies. We provide insights into the characteristics of the optimal policies and evaluate the performance of the resulting policies using simulation.",Probability in the Engineering and Informational Sciences,2020-07-01,10.1017/S0269964818000402
Simulation optimization for the inventory management of healthcare supplies,"This article covers the inventory management of healthcare supplies problem. Based on the mathematical programming model set out by [1], a causal model and a flow chart were developed to outline the simulation model, which was to be later applied to a highly specialized medical institution that performs high-risk heart surgery, such as catheterizations and angioplasties. With this simulation model, a purchases plan with 21 healthcare supplies was obtained that contemplates all the problem’s restrictions: purchasing policy (safety stock, available budget); the warehouse’s physical reality (warehouse capacity); characteristics of supplies (useful life, service level); and suppliers (price, capacity and size of lots or rounding value). Different indicators were also considered, such as service levels, costs of purchases, stockouts costs and inventory maintenance costs. The results obtained with the simulation model came very close to the mathematical programming results, but the computing times were considerably shorter.",International Journal of Simulation Modelling,2020-06-01,10.2507/IJSIMM19-2-514
Influenza vaccine uptake among older adults in Brazil: Socioeconomic equality and the role of preventive policies and public services,"Background: Influenza is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Since 1999, influenza vaccine is provided free-of-charge to adults aged 60 years or more in Brazil. Although vaccination coverage is high, previous studies have shown that socioeconomic and lifestyle factors play an essential role in predicting vaccine uptake. This study aimed to investigate whether previous knowledge of factors that constrain influenza vaccine uptake among older adults contributed to increasing the access to vaccination in 2015–16. Methods: This cross-sectional study assessed data from the baseline of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging. This national representative sample encompassed individuals aged 60 and older (n = 5221). Vaccination status was the outcome variable; covariates included socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics, health status, and access to healthcare. Logistic regression fitted the association between vaccine uptake and covariates. Results: The coverage of influenza vaccination was 73.0% (95% confidence interval: 70.6–75.2); ranking lower than the goal of 80% set up by the national health authority. The most frequent reasons to justify the option of skipping vaccination were cultural beliefs about the lack of efficacy and possible side effects of the vaccine. The coverage of vaccination did not differ by socioeconomic characteristics. Older individuals, never smokers, having two or more chronic diseases, and being registered in the Family Health Program were positively associated with influenza vaccine uptake. Conclusions: Absent socioeconomic inequalities point out changes in the barriers to vaccination. These findings provide insights into tailoring public health strategies, targeting professional recommendations and public perceptions of the vaccine.",Journal of Infection and Public Health,2020-02-01,10.1016/j.jiph.2019.07.022

How to use lean manufacturing for improving a Healthcare logistics performance,"Most companies in the world are focused on their global performance for being competitive on the market. Lean manufacturing is one of the main methodologies used by them for increasing their supply chain and logistics performance. Indeed, Logistics performance improvement implies the definition of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for measuring at each transformation level, the evolution of the logistics system. Thus, Industry 4.0 and logistics 4.0 concepts are defined for implementing new technologies, tools and organizations in companies in order to define their future. A new framework, based on lean manufacturing and DMAIC methodologies, with sustainability as its kernel has been developed in Icam, A Higher education school, for SMEs. In addition, European population is growing older day by day and they are regularly visiting hospitals. In this context, the treatment of patients in good conditions (quality, cost and lead time) is necessary as much as the hospital global performance. In this frame, a project is ongoing between FEI, a Brazilian University and Icam for defining and implementing Healthcare Logistics 4.0 (including lean manufacturing). This paper presents concepts, methods and tools of healthcare logistics 4.0 for improving a hospital performance. Examples on medicines tracking, medicine and food dispatching will be given as result and detailed for illustrating concepts presented.",Procedia Manufacturing,2020-01-01,10.1016/j.promfg.2020.10.231
"Enterprise IoT Modeling: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning","The Internet of Things (IoT)—the internetworking of physical devices—has been a significant advancement in recent decades and has been the catalyst for several other innovations. New Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platforms aim to solve the most complex challenge of manufacturers: consolidating all production systems into a single data model. They are used in smart cities, security and emergencies, environmental applications, energy, healthcare, logistics, industrial control, home automation, agriculture, and animal farming. These objects/devices/appliances can generate, collect, and exchange data without human-to-human or human-to-computer interactions. The IIoT is creating an explosion in structured and unstructured data from a growing army of sensors capable of registering locations, voices, faces, audio, temperature, sentiment, health, and others. Billions of IoT devices are interconnected and a huge volume of data is generated. Every device features automation to assist people in the planning, management, and decision-making of their day-to-day activities. Machine learning (ML) techniques are applied to further enhance the intelligence and capabilities of an application. Many researchers are interested in producing advanced IoT technology, combining ML and IoT Techniques. Through ML, IIoT devices learn to perform tasks such as predication, pattern recognition, classification, and clustering. To provide for a learning process, IoT devices are trained using various algorithms in ML and statistical models to analyze sample data. The various fields of data sets (structured and unstructured data) are characterized by measuring functional parameters. Later, ML algorithms are applied to the data set to find features, provide useful output, identify patterns or make decisions based on the data set, draw inferences from real-time data streams, make their results available to analysts, and embed their results directly in business processes. In ML, the real-time problem is classified by classification, clustering, regression models, and association rules. Based on the learning style, ML algorithms can be categorized as supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning.",EAI/Springer Innovations in Communication and Computing,2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-44407-5_3
Healthcare logistics &amp; supply chain management in health industry of Indonesia based on the telemedicine,"The essential mission of logistics and supply chain management is to efficiently plan, organize, and coordinate the movement of goods from a point of origin to a point of consumption. Analyzing and aligning supply chain goals with a patient-first approach enables healthcare organizations to reduce costs while improving patient outcomes. With Patient Direct, a care delivery solution from HRS, this paper provides patients with the telehealth equipment they need when they need it by telemedicine. Telemedicine which is used interchangeably with the term telehealth is the remote delivery of healthcare to patients through information and communication technology, including communication between two or more health professionals who are not in the same location. Thus, it needs secure transmission of medical data through text, sound, image, or video. This system can be a tele-education, tele-monitoring, tele-consultation, or tele-intervention. Telemedicine has several benefits, both for health professionals and medical institution as well as for the patients, especially for the development of healthcare delivery in remote area and also to make interaction between healthcare professional faster. However, telemedicine still has lack of regulation in Indonesia. There is still no regulation about license for the health professional and safety of medical data. Ethical problems in telemedicine are also still an issue, especially about patient's confidentiality, and also it can weaken doctor-patients relationship. According code of ethics, a doctor must examine the patients first before making a diagnosis and treatment, which cannot be done with telemedicine. The lack of regulation and ethical consideration make telemedicine in Indonesia still has some problems and need a challenge for improvement.",International Journal of Supply Chain Management,2020-01-01,
Evaluating Replenishment Systems for Disposable Supplies at the Operating Theater: A Simulation Case Study,"Ensuring cost containment while providing high quality patient care is of paramount concern to hospitals. The operating theater in particular is a major cost driver for any hospital, and is among the most critical resources in terms of both capacity and patient care. Effective inventory and distribution systems are a prerequisite for realizing efficiency improvements in the internal operating theater supply chain. In this work, discrete-event simulation is used to model part of the internal distribution process in the operating theater at a Belgian Hospital and to identify improvements by focusing on the replenishment process. A logistics performance measurement framework based on Analytic Network Process (ANP), as a popular Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique, is adopted to assess three replenishment scenarios. The best performing scenario is selected using the Internal Logistics Efficiency Performance (ILEP) index as an evaluation basis. This research indicates that industrial engineering techniques, such as simulation and MCDM, which are successfully applied in industrial sectors, can also be adopted to realize efficiency opportunities in healthcare logistics.",Springer Proceedings in Mathematics and Statistics,2020-01-01,10.1007/978-3-030-39694-7_12

Performance evaluation of FIWARE: A cloud-based IoT platform for smart cities,"As the Internet of Things (IoT) becomes a reality, millions of devices will be connected to IoT platforms in smart cities. These devices will cater to several areas within a smart city such as healthcare, logistics, and transportation. These devices are expected to generate significant amounts of data requests at high data rates, therefore, necessitating the performance benchmarking of IoT platforms to ascertain whether they can efficiently handle such devices. In this article, we present our results gathered from extensive performance evaluation of the cloud-based IoT platform, FIWARE. In particular, to study FIWARE's performance, we developed a testbed and generated CoAP and MQTT data to emulate large-scale IoT deployments, crucial for future smart cities. We performed extensive tests and studied FIWARE's performance regarding vertical and horizontal scalability. We present bottlenecks and limitations regarding FIWARE components and their cloud deployment. Finally, we discuss cost-efficient FIWARE deployment strategies that can be extremely beneficial to stakeholders aiming to deploy FIWARE as an IoT platform for smart cities.",Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,2019-10-01,10.1016/j.jpdc.2018.12.010
An evaluation of the delivery of medicines using drones,"This study tests the impact of drone transportation on the quality of a medicine. Modelling the critical process parameters of drone flight, the effects of temperature and vibration on insulin were investigated using the pharmacopoeia methods. The medicine, Actrapid, (3.5 mg/mL of insulin), was flown by a quad-rotor drone. Insulin stored between −20 and 40◦C for 30 mins, and subjected to vibration (0–40 Hz, 25◦C, 30 mins) passed the pharmacopeia tests. Dynamic light scattering identified the active tetrameric and hexameric forms of insulin post testing. Vibration frequencies during drone flight were between 0.1 and 3.4 Hz. There was no evidence of visible insulin aggregates following the drone transportation. The differences in UV absorbance readings between flown Actrapid and controls were insignificant (p = 0.89). No adverse impact of drone transport on insulin was observed. This study provides supporting evidence that drone transportation of medicinal products containing insulin is feasible. The authors recommend that when considering the drone delivery of medicines five tests need to be applied. These tests must determine the safe flight time and range, the quality of the medicine post flight, the onboard conditions experienced by the medicine, the security of the drone supply chain and the effect of drone failure on both the medicine and the environment.",Drones,2019-09-01,10.3390/drones3030052
A novel group ownership transfer protocol for RFID systems,"Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a wireless communication technology nowadays widely used in almost every aspect of our lives including healthcare, logistics and supply chain management, inventory tracking, race timing, access control, toll collection, and a lot more. In RFID systems, a tag usually stores private or sensitive information, and so it needs an access control mechanism. When a tag's owner is changed, the read permission of the tag needs to be transferred from the old owner to the new owner, and this is when ownership transfer schemes come into play. In fact, not only do RFID ownership transfer schemes do ownership transfer, but they have to make sure that the ownership transfer procedure is executed under proper security protection. Besides, in some particular environments, the ownership transfer would be far more efficiently done if the tags could be treated as a group instead of individual tags. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel group ownership transfer protocol that satisfies all important security requirements including mutual authentication, data and location privacy, forward/backward secrecy, ownership privacy, and group ownership integrity. In addition, due to the use of cloud computing, our new protocol provides ubiquitous authentication. Based on homomorphic encryption and quadratic residues, our novel RFID group ownership transfer protocol can have encrypted data efficiently processed, and the communication cost is very low. The results of our BAN logic correctness check, security analysis, and performance evaluation confirm that the new protocol is logically correct and is capable of providing high level security/privacy protection on the basis of high cost-effective performance.",Ad Hoc Networks,2019-08-01,10.1016/j.adhoc.2019.101873
A case study: Application of network clock model to heterogeneous sensor networks,"A sensor network consists of sensor nodes that have sensing, computation and wireless communication capabilities. There are various sensor network applications, including disaster relief operations, environmental monitoring and control, precision agriculture, intelligent home and buildings, facility management, machine surveillance and preventive maintenance, medicine and healthcare, logistics, telematics, and others. Many of these applications share some basic functionalities, namely event detection, periodic measurement and tracking, all of which entail collecting and forwarding of event data. For the purposes of triggering an action, it is necessary to know when an event occurs. Certainly time is an essential factor in many sensor network applications. This paper proposes, based on a cast study, a network clock model application to heterogeneous sensor networks. The network clock model is a scheme by which a consistent notion of time can be shared among sensor networks’ devices in order to enable the combination of time and data for applications. This work serves to demonstrate the acquisition, keeping and distribution of standard time in a heterogeneous sensor network platform based on the network clock model.",Journal of Communications,2019-07-01,10.12720/jcm.14.7.587-592

Investigating automation and AGV in healthcare logistics: a case study based approach,"In France, as in numerous countries, healthcare organisations are undergoing major transformations, leading them to rationalise their resources and optimize their flows. In this context, automation can play an important role, enabling value creation and patient satisfaction. Previous research has mainly focused on the technological aspects of automation, neglecting the organisational issues related to the implementation of this innovation and particularly the management of the hospital staff, including logistics personnel, involved within the organisational change process. The aim of this article is, at least, to partly address this gap within the literature, and to propose, based on an exploratory case study, an analysis grid of the challenges and changes in terms of logistics flows (pharmaceutical, waste, laundry, etc.) that impact staff involved in managing these flows in a hospital context. Our results highlight the importance and necessity of anticipating the building and deployment of new knowledge and skills in order to efficiently and effectively design and manage automated logistics flows with AGV system.",International Journal of Logistics Research and Applications,2019-05-04,10.1080/13675567.2018.1518414
Logistical and structural challenges are the major obstacles for family medicine physicians’ ability to administer adult vaccines,"Purpose: This study was conducted to characterize the vaccination practices and challenges of family medicine physicians in Los Angeles County, California. Methods: The Los Angeles Academy of Family Physicians (LA AFP) sent out electronic surveys to all of their active members (N = 1121) between December 2017 and January 2018, and asked them to answer questions about themselves, their practice, their patient population, and their immunization practices and challenges. We then analyzed the results through basic statistical calculations and Pearson’s chi-squared tests. Results: Seventy-four people (6.6%) responded to the survey, and 75% of responders stated that they administer all Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended vaccines. The lowest vaccine administration rates were for the high-dose influenza vaccine, which 66.2% (n = 49) of respondents reported to administer, followed by the meningococcal B vaccine (68.9%; n = 51). The respondents who belonged to practices with more than 11 providers, were part of a large hospital or healthcare system, had electronic medical records (EMRs), and used the California Immunization Registry (CAIR) were more likely to report to vaccinate. The number one responding physician-reported challenge to vaccination was limited time and resources to address patient resistance followed by vaccine cost and lack of infrastructure to store vaccines. Conclusions: In this pilot study, structural and logistical challenges appeared to make the biggest impact on adult vaccination for the responding family medicine physicians. Solutions addressing these challenges will help improve the adult immunization rates.",Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics,2019-03-04,10.1080/21645515.2018.1543524

Using lean manufacturing and machine learning for improving medicines procurement and dispatching in a hospital,"Industry 4.0 concepts are defined around the use of new technologies for improving industrial companies according to scientific, technological and organizational aspects. Enterprise complex problems could be solved in this frame. Many methods and concepts presented in the literature are focused on these aspects. A new method is being developed in Icam Paris-Sénart around the idea that sustainability must be the kernel of “industry of the future”. Indeed, the framework proposed is a combination of the previous aspects with environmental, social and societal aspects. The actual situation of the planet is an encouragement to make all future transformations with sustainability as kernel. These concepts could be imported in healthcare logistics and transport area for solving specific problems of this domain. Icam (French Engineer school) and FEI University are collaborating for proposing to healthcare hospitals a new framework (healthcare logistics 4.0) for solving complex problems of this domain. This paper is focusing on how to improve medicines procurement and dispatching in a hospital. Indeed, the use of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare sector is growing up. Data treated and analyzed could give important insights for solving problems and improving the existing organization. As machine learning is already exploited in many production management problems (forecasting, storage, production, etc.), the idea is to use it for developing an aided tool in addition to a lean manufacturing classical approach. After presenting the real problem of medicines procurement and dispatching detected in healthcare hospitals, concepts of lean manufacturing and machine learning will be exposed. Then, the methodology proposed for solving the problem will be shown. An illustration will be given for validating concepts presented.

A systematic literature review of simulation models for non-technical skill training in healthcare logistics,"Background: Resource allocation in patient care relies heavily on individual judgements of healthcare professionals. Such professionals perform coordinating functions by managing the timing and execution of a multitude of care processes for multiple patients. Based on advances in simulation, new technologies that could be used for establishing realistic representations have been developed. These simulations can be used to facilitate understanding of various situations, coordination training and education in logistics, decision-making processes, and design aspects of the healthcare system. However, no study in the literature has synthesized the types of simulations models available for non-technical skills training and coordination of care. Methods: A systematic literature review, following the PRISMA guidelines, was performed to identify simulation models that could be used for training individuals in operative logistical coordination that occurs on a daily basis. This article reviewed papers of simulation in healthcare logistics presented in the Web of Science Core Collections, ACM digital library, and JSTOR databases. We conducted a screening process to gather relevant papers as the knowledge foundation of our literature study. The screening process involved a query-based identification of papers and an assessment of relevance and quality. Results: Two hundred ninety-four papers met the inclusion criteria. The review showed that different types of simulation models can be used for constructing scenarios for addressing different types of problems, primarily for training and education sessions. The papers identified were classified according to their utilized paradigm and focus areas. (1) Discrete-event simulation in single-category and single-unit scenarios formed the most dominant approach to developing healthcare simulations and dominated all other categories by a large margin. (2) As we approached a systems perspective (cross-departmental and cross-institutional), discrete-event simulation became less popular and is complemented by system dynamics or hybrid modeling. (3) Agent-based simulations and participatory simulations have increased in absolute terms, but the share of these modeling techniques among all simulations in this field remains low. Conclusions: An extensive study analyzing the literature on simulation in healthcare logistics indicates a growth in the number of examples demonstrating how simulation can be used in healthcare settings. Results show that the majority of studies create situations in which non-technical skills of managers, coordinators, and decision makers can be trained. However, more system-level and complex system-based approaches are limited and use methods other than discrete-event simulation.",Advances in Simulation,2018-12-01,10.1186/s41077-018-0072-7
L'impartition des activités logistiques dans le secteur de la santé: les leçons d'une expérience canadienne,"Logistics activities are seen by many healthcare organizations as an opportunity for financial savings. The level of logistics complexity in these organizations may explain the challenges they face in applying solutions common in other industries.

Logistics practices in healthcare organizations in Bogota,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the current state of logistics practices in healthcare organizations in Bogota, Colombia. Design/methodology/approach: The assessment is based on case study research using open interviews, focused interviews, a questionnaire and direct observations as sources of evidence. Seven Colombian health care settings are analyzed: four public hospitals and three private clinics. Cross-case analysis allows the identification of patterns regarding supply management, inventory management, replenishment and use of information and communication technologies. Findings: Manual procedures, poor planning, little recognition from top management and a lack of specialized personnel characterize the current situation. Innovative practices with a potential to improve the efficacy of logistics activities are rare, particularly in public hospitals. Research avenues: Future research could replicate this study in other Colombian cities, in order to generalize the results to the whole country. It could also be interesting to document successful and less successful implementations of innovative logistics practices in Colombian hospitals to guide and promote their adoption. Research limitations/implications: The small number of cases considered, and the fact that the research is concentrated in one city, limits the generalizability of the results. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is the first to explore the state of healthcare logistics practices in Colombia.",Academia Revista Latinoamericana de Administracion,2018-11-30,10.1108/ARLA-08-2016-0219
Overall user satisfaction with family planning services and associated quality care factors: A cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Studies of user satisfaction with family planning services (FPSs) have been conducted in different countries, and have been employed to identify ways of improving health, reducing costs and implementing reforms. The present work is the first-ever study undertaken in Mexico on the subject. Our objective was to identify how overall user satisfaction with FPSs in Mexico was related to: healthcare logistics, the functional value of services and the quality of interpersonal relations. Methods: Users of 18 public clinics were surveyed in 2015. Data collected referred to their past and present use of FPSs, as well as to their perceptions of the services provided. We built a logistic regression model with potentially influential variables in order to assess their association with overall satisfaction. Results: According to the self-reports of the 722 users interviewed, the following factors were decisive in their overall satisfaction with services: receiving sufficient information during visits (OR = 3.38; 95% CI:1.88-6.06), feeling that their opinions were taken into consideration by clinic staff (OR = 2.58; 95% CI:1.14-5.85), feeling that the motives for their visits were addressed (OR = 2.71; 95% CI:1.29-5.71), being assigned enough time for consultation (OR = 2.35; 95% CI:1.26-4.37), having the opportunity to ask questions and clarify doubts (OR = 2.31; 95% CI:1.21-4.43), experiencing no or few interruptions during their medical consultations (OR = 1.97;95% CI:1.10-3.51), and feeling satisfied with the contraceptive method provided (OR = 1.79; 95% CI:1.03-3.11). Conclusions: Service providers must be kept well informed on the perspective of users concerning user expectations.

Multicommodity flows and Benders decomposition for restricted continuous location problems,"The restricted continuous facility location problem arises when there is a need to locate a number of facilities to serve a discrete set of demand points, and where the location of a facility can be anywhere on the plane except for in restricted regions. The problem finds applications in urban planning, disaster management, and healthcare logistics. The restricted regions can occur randomly or are known in advance. The paper describes a new model for the problem that is based on multicommodity flows with unknown destinations and defined on a discretization of the plane. The model and discretization are applied to both the deterministic and the stochastic continuous restricted location problem, where the latter is converted into a deterministic equivalent problem by minimizing the expected value of the objective function weighted by the probabilities of scenarios. The paper also describes a Benders decomposition algorithm to optimally solve the model. Extensive computational results are presented on both benchmark instances from the literature and new instances, on both the deterministic and stochastic variant of the problem. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is superior to an off-the-shelf solver in terms of computational time. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the exact algorithm described here is the first to address both the deterministic and the stochastic variants of continuous restricted location problems with any number of facilities.",European Journal of Operational Research,2018-05-01,10.1016/j.ejor.2017.11.033
Develop a strategy for improving healthcare logistics performance,"Recently, there has been a great interest in applying logistics and supply chain management practice and strategy in healthcare services. This paper proposes a strategy for improving healthcare logistics performance. Eighteen hospitals located in different countries, namely Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, and Thailand, were interviewed about their national and operational performance. The tool for assessing national healthcare performance, that is, the Health Metric Network framework, developed by the World Health Organization in 2008 was applied to assess the healthcare logistics infrastructure of those countries. Furthermore, we developed set of logistics performance indicators at the operational level. The Analytical Network Process methodology was used to develop the hierarchical measurement for those operational healthcare logistics performances. The results show interdependencies between operational and national performance. The operational performance is affected by the country’s environment. Finally, a strategy for improving healthcare logistics performance is proposed. The interdependences between operational and national performance are discussed.",Supply Chain Forum,2018-01-01,10.1080/16258312.2017.1416876
Healthcare logistics in disaster planning and emergency management: A perspective,"This paper discusses the role of healthcare supply chain management in disaster mitigation and management. While there is an abundance of literature examining emergency management and disaster preparedness efforts across an array of industries, little information has been directed specifically toward the emergency interface, interoperability and unconventional relationships among civilian institutions and the US Department of Defense (US DoD) or supply chain operations involved therein. To address this imbalance, this paper provides US DoD healthcare supply chain managers with concepts related to communicating and planning more effectively. It is worth remembering, however, that all disasters are local - under the auspice of tiered response involving federal agencies, the principal responsibility for responding to domestic disasters and emergencies rests with the lowest level of government equipped and able to deal with the incident effectively. As such, the findings are equally applicable to institutions outside the military. It also bears repeating that every crisis is unique: there is no such thing as a uniform response for every incident. The role of the US DoD in emergency preparedness and disaster planning is changing and will continue to do so as the need for roles in support of a larger effort also continues to change.",Journal of business continuity &amp; emergency planning,2017-12-01,
Outsourcing strategies and distribution models in Italian Pharma Supply Chain,"In the pharmaceutical supply chain, all players have to ensure the highest level of service while containing costs, because of the ethical issues concerning drugs. The outsourcing of logistics should be recognized as a competitive lever, especially in this complex and highly regulated industry. Based on these premises, the research objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between the outsourcing strategies of manufacturers and the logistics services offered by Third-Party Logistics Service providers (3PLs). To achieve this objective, a multiple case study was designed to analyse the different physical distribution models adopted by pharmaceutical companies. We collected qualitative data and the subjective perceptions of several logistics directors, conducting structured interviews with 11 pharmaceutical companies and six 3PLs. We have identified three physical distribution models, on the basis of the number and location of the warehouses used (single warehouse, dual warehouse and multi-warehouse models). We discovered that there is a strict relationship between the physical distribution model adopted by pharmaceutical companies and their features (i.e. the main distribution channel, product portfolio, target service level, transport and warehousing costs and other company related issues). Our research also offers an empirical insight into the key logistic services that 3PLs should offer within the pharma industry. In conclusion, the study draws a roadmap to guide pharmaceutical companies in their strategic logistics decisions in Italy, while also considering possible future trends deriving from changes to European regulations.","Proceedings - 2017 IEEE International Conference on Service Operations and Logistics, and Informatics, SOLI 2017",2017-11-27,10.1109/SOLI.2017.8120990

A structured review of quantitative models of the pharmaceutical supply chain,"The aim of this review is to identify and provide a structured overview of quantitative models in the pharmaceutical supply chain, a subject not exhaustively studied in the previous reviews on healthcare logistics related mostly to quantitative models in healthcare or logistics studies in hospitals. The models are classified into three categories of classification: network design, inventory models, and optimization of a pharmaceutical supply chain. A taxonomy for each category is shown describing the principal features of each echelon included in the review; this taxonomy allows the readers to identify easily a paper based on the actors of the pharmaceutical supply chain. The search process included research articles published in the databases between 1984 and November 2016. In total 46 studies were included. In the review process we found that in the three fields the most common source of uncertainty used is the demand in the 56% of the cases. Within the review process we can conclude that most of the articles in the literature are focused on the optimization of the pharmaceutical supply chain and inventory models but the field on supply chain network design is not deeply studied.",Complexity,2017-01-01,10.1155/2017/5297406

Strategy deployment in healthcare services: A case study approach,"For a number of years, multiple studies have suggested that the effective management of logistics can generate significant gains for healthcare institutions. Yet, the studies also show that despite widespread knowledge of best practices, most institutions struggle to deploy practices that can enhance the logistics performance of their organization. In fact, healthcare institution managers are lacking guidelines enabling them to deploy a logistics strategy supporting the implementation of such practices. Using longitudinal case studies of two Canadian hospitals that made significant improvements in this regard, we will analyze the deployment strategy for exemplary materials management practices. In these studies, we will consider that two aspects are essential in deploying a logistics strategy in a service undertaking. First, there must be well-defined strategic intent. Based on this, the organization must implement an experimental series of logistics practices. This implementation process offers two benefits: 1) it should enable innovative practices to be tested, and 2) it should provide the organization with the time to absorb these innovations, particularly given the complex environment within a hospital.",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2016-12-01,10.1016/j.techfore.2016.09.006

Paving the way for warehouse centralization in healthcare: A preliminary assessment approach,"Centralized logistics management is currently one interesting option for healthcare systems facing an increasing need to improve responsiveness and service quality while reducing costs. This work focuses on one aspect of centralized logistics, namely warehouse centralization and proposes a preliminary approach to assess material management in healthcare institutions as a first step towards decisions about the implementation of such a strategy. A list of variables and relationships between them characterizing warehouse material management are identified based on a literature review and knowledge of real logistics processes. Statistical analysis is then applied to assess the existence of such relationships in a set of healthcare organizations in order to understand the management commonalities that can stimulate warehouse centralization as well as the criticalities that could potentially hinder it. The approach is tested in a healthcare logistics system in Northern Italy. The results proved the ability of the methodology to identify the relevant issues the involved institutions need to work on when undertaking warehouse centralization strategies. The case warehouses revealed a good degree of commonalities in their management practices although three critical aspects were identified, namely a limited efficiency in human resource allocation, a high fragmentation of stock product demand and a relevant number of stock products with low annual demand. This work provides a methodology to increase material managers’ awareness about the factors enabling successful centralized inventory strategies in the healthcare sector.",American Journal of Applied Sciences,2016-05-05,10.3844/ajassp.2016.490.500
A way for reducing drug supply chain cost for a hospital district: A case study,"Purpose: This work aims at providing insights to optimise healthcare logistic of the drug management, in order to deal with the healthcare expenditure cut. In this paper the effects of different drug supply chain configurations, on the resulting average stock, service level and Bullwhip effect, of the studied supply chain, is quantitatively assessed. Design/methodology/approach: A case study of an Italian district has been studied, taking into account three echelons: suppliers, central stock, and hospitals. A model of the various supply chain configurations has been created with the use of the simulation. Specifically, 24 supply chain configurations have been examined, stemming from the combination of several supply chain design parameters, namely: transshipment policies (Emergency Lateral Transshipment or Total Inventory Equalization); re-order and inventory management policies (Economic Order Quantity or Economic Order Interval); required service levels (90% or 95%); the number of available vans (one or two). For each configuration, hospital average stock, service level and a “Bullwhip effect” analysis are computed. To know which input variables are statistically significant, a DoE (Design of Experiments) analysis has been executed. Findings: The output of this paper provides useful insights and suggestions to optimize the healthcare logistic and drug supply chain. According to the developed DoE analysis, it can be stated that the introduction of transshipment policies provides important improvement in terms of service and stock levels. To reduce the Bullwhip effect, which results in a service level decreasing, and in a managing stock costs increasing, it is worth to adopt an EOQ re-order policy. Practical implications: This research gives practical recommendations to the studied system, in order to reduce costs and maintain a very satisfactory service level. Originality/value: This paper fulfils an identified need to study which combination of transshipment policies, re-order/inventory management policies and required service levels, can be the best one to reduce costs and maintain a very satisfactory service level, in the specific logistic system.",Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management,2016-01-01,10.3926/jiem.1262

Selective vehicle routing for a mobile blood donation system,"In this study, a mobile blood collection system is designed with the primary objective of increasing blood collection levels. This design also takes into account operational costs to aim for collection of large amounts of blood at reasonable cost. Bloodmobiles perform direct tours to certain activities to collect blood, but at the end of each day, they bring the collected blood to a designated depot to prevent its spoilage. The proposed system consists of the bloodmobiles and a new vehicle called the shuttle that visits the bloodmobiles in the field on each day and transfers the collected blood to the depot. Consequently, bloodmobiles can continue their tours without having to make daily returns to the depot. We propose a mathematical model and a 2-stage IP based heuristic algorithm to determine the tours of the bloodmobiles and the shuttle, and their lengths of stay at each stop. This new problem is defined as an extension of the Selective Vehicle Routing Problem and is referred to as the SVRP with Integrated Tours. The performances of the solution methodologies are tested first on a real data set obtained from past blood donation activities of Turkish Red Crescent in Ankara, and then on a constructed data set based on GIS data of the European part of Istanbul. The Pareto set of optimum solutions is generated based on blood amounts and logistics costs, and finally a sensitivity analysis on some important design parameters is conducted.",European Journal of Operational Research,2015-08-16,10.1016/j.ejor.2015.03.007

A hierarchical decomposition framework for modeling combinatorial optimization problems,"Complex Optimization Problems has existed in many fields of science, including economics, healthcare, logistics and finance where a complex problem has to be solved. Thus, modeling a complex problem is a fundamental step to relax its complexity and achieve to a final solution of the master problem. Hierarchical optimization is a main step in optimization problems handling process. It consists of decomposing an optimization problem into two or more sub-problems; each sub-problem has its own objectives and constraints. It will help to prove the correct understanding and represent the problem in a different form that facilitates its solving. In this work, we stipulate that a hierarchical decomposition of complex problems can yield to more effective solutions. The proposed framework will contain four possible strategies which will be detailed through this paper; objective based decomposition; constraints based decomposition, semantic decomposition and data partitioning strategy. Each strategy will be argued by a set of examples from the literature to validate our framework. However, some conditions shall be verified to model the problem using such conditions are problems' characteristics that will help to identify if a combinatorial optimization problem can be modeled within the proposed framework and they are detailed in the following subsections.",Procedia Computer Science,2015-01-01,10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.169

Tailoring LTE-advanced for M2M communication using wireless inband relay node,"Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication is one of the newest research fields today and is expected to play a vital role in business areas such as e-healthcare, logistics etc. Mobile communication standards, such as Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) are designed to provide high data rate and broadband services to human-based communication. However, the nature of M2M traffic is different as terminals usually have to transmit small amounts of data infrequently. In this paper, we evaluate an LTE-A Relay Node (RN) based solution to integrate M2M devices into mobile cellular networks. We develop an M2M scenario consisting of both e-healthcare and logistic devices along with normal LTE-A users in our simulation model using OPNET modeler. The simulation results indicate the better performance of LTE-A network if RN is used for the multiplexing and aggregation of M2M data traffic.","Proceedings of World Telecommunications Congress 2014, WTC 2014",2014-01-01,

Healthcare service modeling to minimize disruptions due to natural disasters,"The aftermath of any disaster could be enormous and annihilating especially for healthcare industry. In case of an emergency, the healthcare organizations in the affected region may experience out of stock situation for medical supplies which eventually impact their services. Healthcare providers need to replenish their supplies from central distribution centers or unaffected regional distribution centers. The most difficult situation that authorities face is the complexity of operating conditions where they had to work in order to supply medical items to the affected region from a central position. Some regions may be very difficult to reach under disaster condition. In this scenario it may be required to share medical items from contiguous health care organizations. Operations Research techniques have already been proven to be beneficial for different planning situations, mainly during the preparation and the response phase of disaster life cycle. There are very few works that have been done in the field of inventory relocation in case of a disaster.

Modelling hospital materials management processes,"Materials management is an important issue for healthcare systems because it influences clinical and financial outcomes. Before selecting, adapting and implementing leading or optimized practices, a good understanding of processes and activities has to be developed. In real applications, the information flows and business strategies involved are different from hospital to hospital, depending on context, culture and available resources; it is therefore difficult to find a comprehensive and exhaustive description of processes, even more so a clear formalization of them. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, it proposes an integrated and detailed analysis and description model for hospital materials management data and tasks, which is able to tackle information from patient requirements to usage, from replenishment requests to supplying and handling activities. The model takes account of medical risk reduction, traceability and streamlined processes perspectives. Second, the paper translates this information into a business process model and mathematical formalization.

Potential impact of RFID-based tracing systems on the integrity of pharmaceutical products,"Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is going to play a crucial role as auto-identification technology in a wide range of applications such as healthcare, logistics, supply chain management, ticketing, et cetera. The use of electromagnetic waves to identify, trace, and track people or goods allows solving many problems related to auto-identification devices based on optical reading (i.e. bar code). Currently, high interest is concentrated on the use of Radio Frequency (RF) solutions in healthcare and pharmaceutical supply chain, in order to improve drugs flow transparency and patients' safety. Unfortunately, there is a possibility that drug interaction with electromagnetic fields (EMFs) generated by RF devices, such as RFID readers, deteriorate the potency of bioactive compounds. This chapter proposes an experimental multidisciplinary approach to investigate potential alterations induced by EMFs on drug molecular structure and performance. To show the versatility of this approach, some experimental results obtained on two biological pharmaceuticals (peptide hormone-based) are discussed. © 2013, IGI Global.","Advanced RFID Systems, Security, and Applications",2012-12-01,10.4018/978-1-4666-2080-3.ch011
Progress towards data standards adoption in healthcare,"The contribution of this paper is to report on the progress of and barriers to adoption of data standards in healthcare logistics. This paper is directed to engineering managers with an interest in healthcare management, information management, and supply chain management. Data standards in healthcare logistics fall into two categories: product identification numbers and location identification numbers. Product identification numbers are assigned to any item that may be priced, ordered, or invoiced at any point in any supply chain, location identification numbers are used to identify physical locations to improve the efficiency of communication with the supply chain. The main objective of this paper is to convey the potential benefits of data standards adoption in the healthcare supply chain and present empirical evidence of progress toward adoption as well as a discussion of barriers toward adoption. Data is presented and analyzed from surveys conducted in 2008, 2010 and 2011. The results show encouraging progress being made towards data standards adoption; however, many barriers still exist. Engineering managers will appreciate the potential benefits of data standards adoption in healthcare logistics and will see the role engineers and engineering managers can have in facilitating data standards adoption and overcoming the barriers faced. Engineering managers will also see the opportunities for healthcare process improvement once data standards are adopted.

Smart objects in healthcare: Impact on clinical logistics,"Hospitals are confronted today with a plethora of approaches for asset management with RFID and WLAN, cooling chain monitoring using sensor networks and RFID, and patient tracking using virtually any existing technology. The downside is that most approaches are not necessarily compatible let alone coordinated. Further, none of the technologies is really integrated into legacy systems or corresponding organizational structures and processes, thus the full power of innovative applications is not utilized. Introducing the concept of smart objects inspired by the Internet of Things can improve the situation by separating the capabilities and functions of an object from the implementing technology such as RFID or WLAN. Wireless tags become interchangeable, and business applications can be built independent from the underlying communication network. Supported by synchronized technological and business developments smart objects have the power to transform a hospital from an agglomeration of technologies into a smart environment.",Critical Issues for the Development of Sustainable E-health Solutions,2012-01-01,10.1007/978-1-4614-1536-7_19
From patients' needs to hospital pharmacy management: An holistic approach to the process modelling,"Materials management is a great issue for healthcare systems because it influences performances of structures in terms of clinical and financial outcomes. Enhancements can be done by means of an appropriate management of data related to these materials coming from all processes in which they are involved. This paper presents an integrated and detailed description and model of the hospital materials management process, able to tackle information from patient requirements to materials usage, according to traceability and streamlined processes perspectives. The holistic approach adopted, based on hospital cases analysis, literature review and international guidelines, tends to look at all actors, materials and processes involved, with the attempt to provide academicals and practitioners with a useful guide to the various technology-related, management and business issues that can arise during the design or reengineering of this business process and the associated information system.","1st International Workshop on Innovative Simulation for Health Care, IWISH 2012, Held at the International Multidisciplinary Modeling and Simulation Multiconference, I3M 2012",2012-01-01,
Patient journey modeling using integrated data structures in healthcare service operations,"Improving patient flow and patient satisfaction have attracted considerable interest in recent years. Recognizing the need for taking a holistic approach to improving healthcare service operations, this paper presents an integrated framework for patient journey modeling from admission through to discharge. The proposed framework enhances the capability of service delivery systems to cope with the uncertainty associated with planning and scheduling of healthcare service operations towards achieving the desired patient flow and satisfaction levels. The patient journey model developed based on the unitary structuring technique is illustrated using a selected healthcare scenario, identifying the patient flow with process and data elements, as well as information flows. It is shown that integration of processes, data elements, information flows and relationships enables modeling of patient journey for improving patient flow and satisfaction through effective and efficient planning of healthcare logistics. This patient journey model can be implemented in an enterprise resource planning system environment, as a software tool, for monitoring patient flow in real-time. © 2011 IEEE.","2011 IEEE Colloquium on Humanities, Science and Engineering, CHUSER 2011",2011-12-01,10.1109/CHUSER.2011.6163802
Cognizant healthcare logistics management: Ensuring resilience during crisis,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to convey a message of preparedness and mitigation to key stakeholders throughout the healthcare community concerning healthcare supply chain readiness and preparedness. Design/methodology/approach: Using a review of existent literature, this work examines and expounds upon the impact of effective supply chain management processes in disaster mitigation and planning. Findings: This paper presents a discourse in supply chain managers' involvement in disaster planning, identifying courses of action, and collaboratively planning for crisis. Logistics is a specific genre of skill sets within healthcare operations. Practical implications: Key tenets of logistics readiness and preparedness are often missed when developing strategies for disaster mitigation. While this discussion is directed specifically toward healthcare management, the principles are applicable across a wide array of industries. Social implications: Disaster affects everyone and is likely to occur in any type of organization. Leaders have an inherent responsibility to plan for both expected and unexpected events; the latter can present complexities that require intuitive reaction provided scenarios have been considered in advance. Arguably, the critical path to success involves effective process management and collaborative communications across multiple echelons of managerial responsibilities.

Data standards in healthcare supply chain operations,"This paper presents the challenges and benefits associated with adoption of healthcare supply chain data standards in a hospital environment. In a highly fragmented industry like healthcare with several stakeholders, the adoption and use of common data standards for identifying delivery locations and products is critical. Common data standards ensure system wide interoperability and visibility across the supply chain, contributing to improvements in patient safety and streamlined internal and external supply chain operations. However, the global healthcare industry has been significantly slow in adopting data standards in comparison to other industries like retail, manufacturing. We discuss the results from data standard adoption pilot project conducted by Center for Innovation in Healthcare Logistics (CIHL), University of Arkansas at Washington Regional Medical Center, a 325 bed not-for-profit hospital in Fayet-teville, Arkansas. CIHL data standards pilot involved studying the existing supply chain processes, design, pilot-test, and evaluation of GS1 data standards adoption over a sample of products and a single delivery location at the hospital. We present the results, which demonstrate the capabilities of systemwide improvements and roadblocks likely to be encountered. Findings from the pilot can be expanded to develop a broad implementation plan of data standards adoption for healthcare providers.",61st Annual IIE Conference and Expo Proceedings,2011-01-01,
Towards flexible process support on mobile devices,"Ubiquitous computing is considered as enabler for linking everyday life with information and communication technology. However, developing pervasive and mobile applications that provide personalized user assistance still constitutes a challenge. Mobile application scenarios are diverse and encompass domains like healthcare, logistics, and sales. For their support two fundamental technologies with increasing maturity are emerging: development frameworks for mobile devices and light-weight process engines. Their integrated use, however, is in a rather premature state. Generally, the use of a process engine for supporting mobile collaboration raises many challenging issues. This paper picks up some of these challenges and shows how we have coped with them in the MARPLE project. MARPLE targets at a tight integration of process management technology with mobile computing frameworks in order to enable mobile process support in advanced application scenarios. We give insights into the MARPLE architecture and its components. In particular, we introduce the MARPLE process engine, which enables light-weight as well as flexible process support on mobile devices. This will be key for mobile user assistance in advanced application scenarios. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2011-01-01,10.1007/978-3-642-17722-4_11

Enabling process support for advanced applications with the aristaflow BPM suite,"A process-aware information system (PAIS) will be not accepted by end users if its software clients do not support their native workows or are too complex for them. When implementing business processes based on process management technology important issues are, therefore, how end-users can participate in the execution of the processes and how this can be accomplished as intuitively as possible. This becomes extremely important if high exibility demands need to be fulfilled during process execution, while PAIS robustness and error safety need to be assured. In this software demonstration we show how the AristaFlow BPM Suite { an adaptive process management system developed by us { was applied to challenging applications in domains like healthcare, logistics, disaster management, and software development. The implementation of adaptive software clients in these different applications particularly proves the benefits provided by an open application programming interface (API) as offered by AristaFlow.",CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2010-12-01,
Measuring the performance of drug logistics: Application of a methodology to two case studies,"The work presents a methodological framework for the analysis of costs and benefits of innovation in healthcare logistics. The framework is applied to drug logistic models into two hospital sites with different systems. One hospital is characterized by the introduction of advanced technologies and the unit dose system for drugs distribution, while the other one is based on a traditional logistic system. The performance comparison is conducted according to four dimensions: quality, costs, benefits and patient safety. The unit dose system shows relevant advantages in terms of costs and patient safety. The introduction of logistic technologies implies organizational and cultural changes and a strong investment at the beginning, but the benefits in terms of efficiency and improvement of patient safety are relevant.",Mecosan,2010-04-01,
Red cell storage,"Blood component storage allows the donor and recipient to be separated in time and space. This separation converts transfusion from a desperate clinical act into a planned, orderly healthcare logistic activity with concomitant increases in both blood product availability and safety. However, storage has the potential to reduce the efficacy of transfused blood components by reducing their flow, functional capacity, and survival. Storage time also allows the accumulation of leaked potassium from red cells and the growth of contaminating bacteria. Many different aspects of the red cell storage lesion have been described, including changes in metabolism, shape, and rheology changes, loss of membrane carbohydrates, lipids and proteins, and alterations in secretion, oxygen delivery, and adhesion. What has been harder to show is that these known changes have significant clinical effects. Therefore, regulatory decisions about product storage have been conservative, and largely based on historic patterns of use. The increasing power of proteomics and metabolomics offers the potential of deeper understanding of blood function and storage and of better clinical products in the future. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Towards restraining cost in healthcare domain: A multiagent approach,"The proliferating cost with-in the healthcare domain is forcing the researchers and practitioners alike to revisit healthcare logistics domain again and again in order to control the cost. However, controlling healthcare cost requires that limits be placed either on prices, quantities of services or both. As prices can be easily controlled by effectively focusing on the mechanism rather then involving and arguing about the services. The prototype developed has directed its attention towards coordination and intelligence in order to effectively manage the logistics while aiming for the improvement of mechanism. Coordination and user profiling has been demonstrated in multi agent environment. The idea here is to order medicines using human expertise in the form of fuzzy logics and effective coordination of different hospital pharmacies for an efficient use of medicines.",Innovation and Knowledge Management in Business Globalization: Theory and Practice - Proceedings of the 10th International Business Information Management Association Conference,2008-01-01,
The case for healthcare supply chain management: Insights from problem-solving approaches,"The US healthcare industry is a large enterprise accounting for over 14.1% of the national economic output in 2001. It has been under pressure for cost containment and providing quality healthcare services to consumers. Its record of investing heavily in the development of sophisticated drugs and diagnostic systems does not match that of technologies to manage its day-to-day operations. In order to achieve improved performance, the healthcare supply chain must be efficient and integrated. The driver for this integration is logistics and supply chain management. This paper describes trends, issues and some solutions for logistics management for the healthcare supply chain with concepts drawn from industrial engineering, and operations research disciplines applied to specific domains.

Use of simulation, optimisation and information-sharing techniques are demonstrated to optimise purchasing and inventory policies. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",International Journal of Procurement Management,2008-01-01,10.1504/IJPM.2008.017525
Six Sigma and Lean in healthcare logistics centre design and operation: A case at North Mississippi Health Services,"This paper presents a case study of applying the principles and procedures of Six Sigma and Lean Thinking in designing and operating a healthcare logistics centre. The customer needs were identified from the viewpoint of patients and four critical-to-quality parameters were defined as the fill rate, accuracy rate, efficiency and expiration/ spoilage rates. Based on the identified core and value-adding steps, the centre layout was designed and 11 initiatives were implemented to improve the critical-to-quality parameters. The project resulted in better storage management, better use of space, an improved and cleaner workspace, more timely and efficient delivery of the right items with the right amount to the right patients and tracking and reducing waste. The logistics centre is currently running in a lean way, in the sense of the same amount of staff, more items to patients, and an $800,000 annual saving. © 2008, Inderscience Publishers.",International Journal of Six Sigma and Competitive Advantage,2008-01-01,10.1504/IJSSCA.2008.021840
The iet in service industries,"Were you aware that consumers spend 60% of their dollars on services versus only 12% on durable goods? These statistics underscore data showing that in the past 10 years employment in manufacturing sector has declined from over 17% to just 11%, while employment in health care, logistics, and other service industries has risen from 13% to 17%. Recent articles in a wide variety of publications, discuss the carry-over of industrial engineering technology tools and techniques from manufacturing to the service industries. Industrial Engineering Technology courses focus on the goals of improving productivity, quality, and safety while reducing costs. Since these goals are suited to any industry, regardless of its economic sector, students in the Industrial Engineering Technology program are uniquely suited to transition from employment opportunities in manufacturing industries to employment opportunities in service enterprises. IET programs have always been known for maintaining excellence through innovative courses, class activities, and the exploration of new fields of opportunity. Now more than ever, IET programs need to expand their knowledge and use of service industry applications. As global competition continues to grow and U.S. service industries multiply, our IET graduates should be poised to meet the challenges unique to the service industries. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the changes necessary to enable IET programs to seriously integrate topics from healthcare, logistics, e-business, and other service industries into its core courses. It will also discuss how curricula changes will enhance students' skill set, increase the variety of their job opportunities upon graduation, and enable us to market our programs more effectively to a broader range of potential students in the future. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2006.","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings",2006-01-01,
The future of asset management,"Deming was famous for asking people, ""By What Method?"" an objective would be accomplished. Any useful concept has embedded in it the answer to that question. Asset Management, to be a valuable concept, must demonstrate a method that leads to success. The method should be inclusive of all the necessary elements, yet be simple to understand. We present a broader view of Asset Management here, built upon three core operating functions: Lead, Execute and Enable. The Execute function is always performed in the plant environment. Manufacturing success is relative to the competition however. Whoever can make the best products at the lowest cost will win. Lead and Enable are the great determinants of that relative success. In addition, Physical Asset Management has an identity crisis. Most practitioners use the term synonymously with the maintenance function. Asset Management's opportunity, however, goes beyond maintenance to be a guiding principal for all of manufacturing. This paper explores the four integrated facets of the Execute function in the plant: Capacity acquisition and disposition Production Asset Healthcare Logistics Our model, then, represents the Future of Asset Management, suggesting ""The Method"", necessary elements for successful manufacturing.","Proceedings of the 1st World Congress on Engineering Asset Management, WCEAM 2006",2006-01-01,10.1007/978-1-84628-814-2_50
Healthcare logistics: A comparative study in 12 hospitals,"Hospitals are characterized by, its complexity, the simultaneous presence of two distribution chains: the external and the internal. The external supply chain includes the multitude of different supplies and the distribution channels through which they flow. For the internal supply chain to the patient care units, hospitals must deploy their own distribution network. According to several studies, it is estimated that 46% of a hospital's total operating budget is spent on logistics related activities. Nursing staff will spend on average 10% of their time on logistic tasks. Due to the diversity of the healthcare materials management in hospitals, distributors were offering, instead of the conventional replenishment method, a stockless replenishment method, whereby the distributor picks and packs products, according to the needs of each patient care unit, and delivers them directly. The practices identified for the internal supply chain management systems are 1) on view, 2) par level systems or 3) the implementation of double container replenishment systems also called two bin or empty-full. The study shows that the hospitals of the survey have made supply chain integration efforts. The author first describes some theoretical concepts based on literature, the results of the empirical study in 12 Flemish hospitals is then explained. It examines the internal and external supply chain of healthcare materials management of three materials 1) linen, 2) materials of the central store and 3) sterile medical supplies.
